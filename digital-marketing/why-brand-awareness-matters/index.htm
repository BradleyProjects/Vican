right reasons. Which is why you need to be leading the conversation and measuring your efforts.</div><main class="article-body"><div class="rich-html"><p>Marketing and sales are important, but brand awareness has an underrated role to play in driving sales. In fact, 82% of consumers searching online <a title="consumers favor brands that they know" target="_blank" href="https://www.insightsforprofessionals.com/en-us/marketing/digital-marketing/how-to-measure-brand-awareness">favor brands that they know</a>.</p><p>Most marketers will highlight brand awareness as a crucial cornerstone of their digital marketing and lead generation strategy. The concept of brand awareness, however, can seem vague and challenging to measure effectively. That&#x27;s why we’ve turned to marketing experts to learn what brand awareness is, why it’s important and how you can measure it.</p><h2>What Is Brand Awareness?</h2><p>While brand awareness generally means how familiar consumers are with your company and its products or services, it’s essential to get more specific than this. Jake Taylor, marketing analyst at <a title="CORT" target="_blank" href="https://www.cort.com/">CORT</a>, believes companies need to consider whether brand awareness means customers have heard their name before, or that their customers understand their specific products or services. Brand awareness is defined by the goals of the marketing team.</p><p><span></span></p><p>For companies that don’t sell everyday items, for example, it’s not as important for their brand to be top of mind for consumers. “Instead, I want to know that when our customer needs us, they recognize the brand and understand the services we provide,” said Taylor. That’s why brand awareness can mean something different for every organization.</p><p><strong>Related Article: <a title="Toxic Branding and How to Counteract It" href="https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/toxic-branding-and-how-to-counteract-it/">Toxic Branding and How to Counteract It</a></strong></p><h2>Why Brand Awareness Matters</h2><p>It’s crucial that customers remain familiar with your company, so they consider your product or service when they make purchase decisions. “If consumers are familiar with your product/service, then you have a higher chance they will make a purchase from you,” explained Andrew Ruditser, lead technology coordinator at <a title="MAXBURST" target="_blank" href="https://www.maxburst.com/">MAXBURST</a>. Even if your brand isn’t top of mind for consumers, if they’re aware of your brand then they’ll think of your product or service first when they’re shopping.</p><p>“Brand awareness is the fuel that keeps new leads coming into your business so that ultimately you can convert them into customers and hopefully brand ambassadors,” added Slisha Kankariya, co-founder of <a title="With Clarity" target="_blank" href="https://www.withclarity.com/">With Clarity</a>. Beyond generating a steady stream of potential leads, brand awareness can create brand ambassadors that spread your brand through word of mouth. In this way, brand awareness can have a snowball effect, and your audience can grow exponentially.</p><p>In Taylor’s opinion, brand awareness is the foundation for building customer relationships. “That being said,” he warned, “brand awareness goes hand in hand with brand reputation — it doesn’t help if people know who you are for the wrong reasons.” That’s why companies need to be actively measuring and promoting a positive brand image.</p><p>When it comes to building brand awareness, therefore, companies need to consider how they want to be perceived. Kankaraya suggested, “brand awareness is crucial to execute well at all stages of the purchasing cycle (not just the initial stages).” This means having highly targeted branding efforts that are consistent and coordinated throughout the customer journey.</p><section class="styles_learning-opportunities-block__rZIRQ"><h2 class="styles_learning-opportunities-block__header__25Uzx">Learning

Chatbot</a></strong></p><h2>How to Measure Brand Awareness</h2><p>When it comes to measuring brand awareness, there are many key metrics you should track, but just like brand awareness itself, the most important key performance indicators (KPIs) vary widely among organizations. </p><p>Kankariya believes the metrics for brand awareness depend on the specific channels your brand uses regularly. With email marketing, for example, she said, “Email signups, likes, email opens, link clicks, calls, chat requests, orders, return rate and earned media are all great measures of understanding how consistently your brand story is ‘selling’ your product or service.” And there are similarly set of KPIs for other channels like content marketing and social media marketing.</p><p>More specifically, Taylor believes tools like Google Surveys are crucial for getting a snapshot of your brand awareness. “There are many survey tools,” he stated, “but we find that this is the most convenient way of getting a representative sample of the general population.” Taylor recommends looking for irregularities since the last survey or variations in responses between different demographics. These outliers could prompt more in-depth research to determine whether there are issues with your brand image.</p><p>“Keeping track of these metrics will help you understand which strategies you&#x27;re using [actually attracts and increases your audience],” explained Ruditser. An increase in some of these key indicators, for example, let’s you know your brand is reaching a larger audience and gaining more recognition. </p><p>Similarly, through more subjective survey data you could find that your brand image is fragmented or unclear to consumers. These insights let you adjust your course and ensure your building a highly consistent and compelling brand image that grows awareness organically. “If they don’t know you, they can’t engage with you, form an opinion about you, and most importantly, transact with you,” said Taylor. Brand awareness, therefore, is critical to driving sales and increasing your company’s bottom line.</p></div></main><div class="styles_about-the-author-block__2CoVG"><h2

In fact, 82% of consumers searching online \u003ca href=\"https://www.insightsforprofessionals.com/en-us/marketing/digital-marketing/how-to-measure-brand-awareness\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"consumers favor brands that they know\"\u003efavor brands that they know\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost marketers will highlight brand awareness as a crucial cornerstone of their digital marketing and lead generation strategy. The concept of brand awareness, however, can seem vague and challenging to measure effectively. That's why we\u0026rsquo;ve turned to marketing experts to learn what brand awareness is, why it\u0026rsquo;s important and how you can measure it.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat Is Brand Awareness?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile brand awareness generally means how familiar consumers are with your company and its products or services, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to get more specific than this. Jake Taylor, marketing analyst at \u003ca href=\"https://www.cort.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CORT\"\u003eCORT\u003c/a\u003e, believes companies need to consider whether brand awareness means customers have heard their name before, or that their customers understand their specific products or services. Brand awareness is defined by the goals of the marketing team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article-body-ad-placeholder\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor companies that don\u0026rsquo;t sell everyday items, for example, it\u0026rsquo;s not as important for their brand to be top of mind for consumers. \u0026ldquo;Instead, I want to know that when our customer needs us, they recognize the brand and understand the services we provide,\u0026rdquo; said Taylor. That\u0026rsquo;s why brand awareness can mean something different for every organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/toxic-branding-and-how-to-counteract-it/\" title=\"Toxic Branding and How to Counteract It\"\u003eToxic Branding and How to Counteract It\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy Brand Awareness Matters\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s crucial that customers remain familiar with your company, so they consider your product or service when they make purchase decisions. \u0026ldquo;If consumers are familiar with your product/service, then you have a higher chance they will make a purchase from you,\u0026rdquo; explained Andrew Ruditser, lead technology coordinator at \u003ca href=\"https://www.maxburst.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"MAXBURST\"\u003eMAXBURST\u003c/a\u003e. Even if your brand isn\u0026rsquo;t top of mind for consumers, if they\u0026rsquo;re aware of your brand then they\u0026rsquo;ll think of your product or service first when they\u0026rsquo;re shopping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Brand awareness is the fuel that keeps new leads coming into your business so that ultimately you can convert them into customers and hopefully brand ambassadors,\u0026rdquo; added Slisha Kankariya, co-founder of \u003ca href=\"https://www.withclarity.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"With Clarity\"\u003eWith Clarity\u003c/a\u003e. Beyond generating a steady stream of potential leads, brand awareness can create brand ambassadors that spread your brand through word of mouth. In this way, brand awareness can have a snowball effect, and your audience can grow exponentially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Taylor\u0026rsquo;s opinion, brand awareness is the foundation for building customer relationships. \u0026ldquo;That being said,\u0026rdquo; he warned, \u0026ldquo;brand awareness goes hand in hand with brand reputation \u0026mdash; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t help if people know who you are for the wrong reasons.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s why companies need to be actively measuring and promoting a positive brand image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to building brand awareness, therefore, companies need to consider how they want to be perceived. Kankaraya suggested, \u0026ldquo;brand awareness is crucial to execute well at all stages of the purchasing cycle (not just the initial stages).\u0026rdquo; This means having highly targeted branding efforts that are consistent and coordinated throughout the customer journey.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article-body-ad-placeholder\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article-body-webinars-placeholder\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/8-considerations-when-branding-your-chatbot/\" title=\"8 Considerations When Branding Your Chatbot\"\u003e8 Considerations When Branding Your Chatbot\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow to Measure Brand Awareness\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to measuring brand awareness, there are many key metrics you should track, but just like brand awareness itself, the most important key performance indicators (KPIs) vary widely among organizations.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKankariya believes the metrics for brand awareness depend on the specific channels your brand uses regularly. With email marketing, for example, she said, \u0026ldquo;Email signups, likes, email opens, link clicks, calls, chat requests, orders, return rate and earned media are all great measures of understanding how consistently your brand story is \u0026lsquo;selling\u0026rsquo; your product or service.\u0026rdquo; And there are similarly set of KPIs for other channels like content marketing and social media marketing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore specifically, Taylor believes tools like Google Surveys are crucial for getting a snapshot of your brand awareness. \u0026ldquo;There are many survey tools,\u0026rdquo; he stated, \u0026ldquo;but we find that this is the most convenient way of getting a representative sample of the general population.\u0026rdquo; Taylor recommends looking for irregularities since the last survey or variations in responses between different demographics. These outliers could prompt more in-depth research to determine whether there are issues with your brand image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Keeping track of these metrics will help you understand which strategies you're using [actually attracts and increases your audience],\u0026rdquo; explained Ruditser. An increase in some of these key indicators, for example, let\u0026rsquo;s you know your brand is reaching a larger audience and gaining more recognition. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, through more subjective survey data you could find that your brand image is fragmented or unclear to consumers. These insights let you adjust your course and ensure your building a highly consistent and compelling brand image that grows awareness organically. \u0026ldquo;If they don\u0026rsquo;t know you, they can\u0026rsquo;t engage with you, form an opinion about you, and most importantly, transact with you,\u0026rdquo; said Taylor. Brand awareness, therefore, is critical to driving sales and increasing your company\u0026rsquo;s bottom line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article-body-ad-placeholder\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","publicationDate":"2019-08-27T15:18:15Z","primaryCategory":{"title":"Digital Marketing","url":"/digital-marketing/"},"topicId":"customer-experience","socialSharing":{},"isSponsored":false,"topicName":"Customer Experience"},"relatedArticlesData":[{"href":"/digital-marketing/unleashing-ais-marketing-potential-in-the-metaverse/","id":"cd1ddf89-c1bc-4187-a8d0-36de872af656","contentType":"Feature","imgSrc":"/-/media/43b6a94d103245d29da3e23ec6035b0b.ashx","imgAlt":"Humanoid white robot with metaverse technology concept wearing virtual reality glasses and reaching up toward ","channel":"Digital Marketing","title":"Unleashing AI's Marketing Potential in the Metaverse","description":"AI has the potential to make the metaverse more immersive, interactive and accessible, while maintaining a secure and respectful environment.

I was shocked at the passion that the residents and natives that I met in Austin, Texas, had for these bats. This is the new Silicon Valley we're talking about. Right? Austin, Texas. This is the place where they have some of the best food in the world. We're so close to Mexico, we have all this history and culture. Yeah.

So let's start here, though, you know, I know about you, because I met you a couple of weeks ago. But I would love our audience to get a little insight on the career for you and your trajectory and how you kind of ended up in this CX leadership role at TurboTax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarietta:\u003c/strong\u003e I've been in CX in some way, shape or form my whole life. I kind of laugh because my first job out of college, my title was letter writer. And I responded to customer letters for the president and CEO of this bank. And this was like way back in the day when you could still smoke in the office and all that stuff, like totally Mad Men. And so it just kind of went from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did a stint at what is now \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.corelogic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CoreLogic\"\u003eCoreLogic\u003c/a\u003e, wound up being a marketing director for them for a while, had kids, ran my own consulting business doing CX types of things for different companies, and then got back into the work world full time, like full bore in the startup space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was a whole new world for me, moving that fast.

And I'm like, ah, the recruiter, you know, that got this message from this recruiter out of the blue. And so I read the job description. And I'm — I replied so fast that the recruiter, are you sure did you like actually read it? I'm like, oh, yeah. Everything in here is like my dream job. You know, sign me up now, man. And so that's how it happened.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the world's fastest interview process. I was actually talking to another large, really well-known company. And they were just so slow on the uptake that Intuit just beat them all hollow, rapid interview with my now boss sitting in an airport giving me the final interview. They made the offer the next day, and I have been a happy clam ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Nice. Every tax year. You've been a happy clam. That's great. And how many years now? How many tax years has it been? We were speaking tax terms? OK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarietta:\u003c/strong\u003e Only two tax seasons. And yes, everything is actually measured in my life, not just by the tax season, but as we call them peaks, is it first peak is it second peak? And then third peak in October when everybody finishes their extension? So are we you know, I get all my early testing done in that time period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAgile CX: Transforming Customer Experience With Data-Based Pivots\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, you talked in Austin at CMSWire Connect about that very topic, \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/growing-beyond-agile-adaptability-for-todays-marketing-landscape/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"agile CX\"\u003eagile CX\u003c/a\u003e, I think that's a good place to start, you know, how would you define agile CX I'm sure people in the business world obviously know the term “agile” but when you apply to CX, what are you talking about there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarietta:\u003c/strong\u003e it actually applies very closely adhering to the principles that the original dudes who came up with the \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Agile Manifesto for software development\"\u003eAgile Manifesto for software development\u003c/a\u003e, it really applies to that. So it used to be, you'd have your big marketing plan, and you would execute on it to heaven and earth to be able to move things quickly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast, in agile, I'm going to really found on what my customers problem is, but I'm going to operate really, really quickly. So just like in software development, where they tend to operate now, you know, if you're an agile organization, it's the same thing and CX, so I can have a plan, right, but I'm going to break it up into bite-sized chunks.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if I'm going along, and the data comes back differently, or, you know, something indicates that I need to take a different direction. I can pivot extremely rapidly, like sometimes daily, I can pivot which way I'm going. So we had a recent campaign that is related to one of our additional products. And we met every single day, we met with our partners who were running the experts, most of our product experts are not employees, but they're seasonal employees.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so we have some partners that we've worked with for many, many years and understand our needs. And we have repeat people come back season after season after season. So we met with them. I'm meeting with learning and development, we're interviewing the experts, we’re listening in on customer phone calls, we're tweaking training as we go, I actually came up with some TikToks, some roleplay. To address different needs, there's really it's a super fast, really quick process, where you're checking the data, every single day, here's where we think we want, you know, we're aiming at landing, here's where we actually are landing, is it better or worse baseline? What changes do we need to make?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so in a matter of four weeks, we ran through a complete experiment process. And actually, I'm working with the design team to implement some tooling inside our \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/understanding-customer-relationship-management-crm-the-basics-and-beyond/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CRM\"\u003eCRM\u003c/a\u003e, because we're going to roll this to baseline across our organization come October. So that's super fast, not how it used to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/agility-is-no-longer-optional-in-business/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Agility Is No Longer Optional in Business\"\u003eAgility Is No Longer Optional in Business\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTurning Giant Corporations Agile: It Starts with People and Speed\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, four weeks is like four seconds in the business world, like you're trying to get people convinced on something that the data is telling you about your customers. And that takes four months sometimes. Right? I mean, I'm sure you've been at businesses before this, where you're like, oh, this would have taken me a half a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarietta: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, yeah. Oh, for sure. And that really is a change in perspective. And that if you're going to do agile, you're not going to have it all nailed down, like 70% certainty. Woohoo, let's move. And that was a real shift for me. Moving from more of a standard corporate mindset, I was in banking forever. OK, you know, so it was like, everything was so tightly controlled. There’s a lot of nos. It's very much command and control structure. Super customer oriented, very command and control.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I go from that into startup world, run this series of very agile companies. And then I think, Oh, well, it's probably going to slow down when I go down to it. Whoa, this is the fastest, biggest 40-year old startup I’ve ever been in. There is no waiting around, which both makes it really fun and can be a challenge if it's not a type of working style that you're used to.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even though I was used to moving fast, this was still even faster, right? One-hundred days in the tax season. I have a very limited time to get a lot of goodness in. And so even for myself, I had to go oh, I can't wait till next week. I have to do this today before I can leave my desk, I have to get this done, I have to get this data, I have to get analyze it, I have to decision, I have to get my stakeholders on board. Whereas before I could be like, I got a couple of weeks to do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eSo getting to the point where you can make at this big corporation, this big startup, if you will, you can make decisions that are impactful, but also take only about a month to do maybe even less, two weeks, let's say, how do we get to that point, because people in the crowd at CMSWire Connect when you were giving this talk, I'm sure they're like, hey, we want to be agile, too. But we have all these blockers and this, there's always excuses of not to start. So my question to you is you've done it successfully with your teams. Where do you start? Like, where's the first place? Is it the people? Is it the hiring? Is it the tools to infuse this agility into your organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarietta: \u003c/strong\u003eSo if you have the ability, if you're situated in your organization, where you can drive agility from the top down, there's one set of answers. And if you are in a place where you're going to have to drive agility from the bottom up, so to speak, there's another set of answers, but they both truly start in the same place. And that's with people. If you have people who are going to be resistant to moving fast, you can't train that out of them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I had long conversations with one of my CEOs who had worked in different large insurance companies that run operations for USAA. And it was such a, I would still I would walk on broken glass for this guy, Steve, I love you. He’s so awesome. Love you, Steve. We talked about this a lot because he had an experience where they tried to change the culture of an organization to be agile, and it went so far as to create almost a mirror organization. And the original Goliath eventually ate the small David. So he was really depressed about that, how can I ever change culture, if it's created in that way, I can't push it forward. And so if you find if you're a leader, and you're in an organization, where you're trying to, to turn the ship of state, there will be people who are ready, and they are ready to go with you. And then there will be other people that you'll need to put in places where they're going to be happy. And limited. Or, you know, maybe I hate to say it, but maybe it's not a fit for them in the long term. And that really is a case by case basis for each individual company.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you're going to get your hiring profile right, you want people who are going to be really empathetic and customer oriented and have extreme ownership. Because with agile, everything that you do isn’t going to come down from above. I think about it, we talked about the \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/the-deep-neural-network-of-ai-that-misleads-results-374252\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"neural networks in AI\"\u003eneural networks in AI\u003c/a\u003e and how you have this self organizing almost group of nodes, right. And that's what agile is, in a company that does it well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it means as a leader, I can't control everything. I'm going to make my North Star, very clear. I'm going to make sure I have the right people. And maybe I need to do a personality test. I think it was Office Depot. But iI could be wrong, who was trying to change some culture. had everybody in the company do a Myers Briggs, and found that most people were saying, you know, answering the question like no, I don't want to work with customers, who are their frontline people. That's all I got.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/failing-at-agile-youre-doing-it-wrong/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Failing at Agile?

And the guy says, Hey, you owe this whole customer thing. I'm not going to quite do that part of the job, but I'll do anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarietta:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I'll do it. Right, right. So it's like no, like, of course, you don't necessarily want your engineers customer facing, but you want them to be able to understand the customer pain or problems or whatever that drives it. So if you've got you know, your North Star, you've looked at your people. And then you have to make it safe to experiment and to learn and that means to fail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. And so, you know, we're talking about agile being great and good all the time. However, do you have any examples of like, moving too fast? Maybe like, right, like, yeah, you know, like, hey, it's great that we rolled this TikTok campaign out in 24 hours. But how did it do? Right? If you can think of any examples like that, that'd be great. Because there’s cautions here, this cautionary tales, I'm sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarietta: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we were anxious to move a proactive experience where we were offering help to customers that at times, we thought they needed it. And it made sense, you know, the face of it, of course, but we moved quick, I'm gonna guess we didn't do the in depth, follow me homes and customer research, we were super, super fast. And when we got to the end of it, we put a lot of resources, we staffed it, specially. I had special cues and specially trained experts and changed our learning and development programs, and how we handled next best action guidance. And we got to the end of the season. And when all that was a bust. Like, like that didn't do anything. And so in the retro it's why, why did that not do anything? And what were the surprise was is it was a bust? But it's not a bust, and that we got some really good learnings out of it. Don't do that things that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, you have the model of failure. And because you were able to use Sprint's use agile so fast that you rolled it out and said, All right, well, it didn't work. Next time, we're going to maybe change it up a little bit. So yeah, so you have that data now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarietta: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. Why don't we actually did change it up during the season? Well, let's tweak this thing. And see, no. We're humans are funny creatures. Sometimes we get it wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes the data just gives you the answer. Right? So those metrics, like what are the primary metrics you're staring at, you know, each day to help infuse and empower your agile methodologies? What are you looking at mostly? What type of tool are you using to get all this great data from all these consumers using TurboTax. And the other properties?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarietta: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, my favorite most used metric, I should say, is \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article126736.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"NPS\"\u003eNPS\u003c/a\u003e. And that is both on a transactional level, as well as when you finish using the product. We also collect some sentiment data in the middle of the experience that we've leveraged very effectively, and there's even more goodness to get in there.

So I want to know what that looks like in practice, because it's all the buzz obviously. So when you are leveraging emotionally I what does that look like? What does that mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarietta: \u003c/strong\u003eSo still in the process of it. So I don't have a lot of data. This is my passion project right now, way, way back. I looked into this, like in 2015. When these models were just getting off the ground, but what it looks like and there are several companies who excel at this and they all have a little different spin on it. So they can use facial mapping. They can use voice analysis that focuses on tone and resonance and literally what vibration are you at? There are ones that you can really get into If you're gonna do this, like in an experimental level where you can hook people up to things that measure the moisture in their skin and their heart rate, all of that stuff that really invasive level of emotional monitoring has been around for some time. But it's only been used in panels or specific cases where somebody has said, yes, yes, you can do this to me, right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at scale, what it can look like is, I'm going to listen to what you're saying and how you're saying it, if you dial in, I'm going to analyze what you select, we actually ask people in that product, how you feeling? And then we give them the opportunity to tell us, right, and it's the smiley frowny face kind of thing. And then if they want to give us more information, there's little pills that they can click on as to why or they can leave us verbatim. And then we actually call those people back. Not all of them, not all of them, that would be a lot. We do have different standards as to what is actionable and what is not actionable. We actually call them back to say, Hey, we got your survey, that you're not feeling so great about your taxes, can I support you in any way? And people are like, what you're kidding me? Wow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYou should partner up with \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/research/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Johns Hopkins\"\u003eJohns Hopkins\u003c/a\u003e or something, you know, you gotta have some therapeutic services from the best of the business.

That's a pretty powerful initiative to do that. What have been the returns on that one? I mean, do you get a lot of feedback on the phone calls? Like, now you're like feedback upon the \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/5-ways-to-optimize-your-customer-feedback-program/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"feedback\"\u003efeedback\u003c/a\u003e kind of thing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarietta:\u003c/strong\u003e Oh, yes. Not only do we analyze the recordings, right, because every phone call is monitored and recorded. Unless the customer says don't, of course, caveat. So we can analyze that we get NPS scores for the interaction with the expert after that. And we leverage all that to say, Hey, are we on target? Are we not? So we had a goal before this project was launched, which we exceeded. So it had about a 5% increase in retention for those who were included in it. Right. So obviously, we’ve expanded and it’s still going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eCool. So what's the moment of relief for you guys?

It's like, Rudy, you said, All Marietta, you know, we all get to relax a little bit. You take a breath after season. And it ends, you know, the April filing deadline comes and goes, Man, it hasn't slowed down yet, Rudy. It's like the false peak when you're a runner and you think you hit the top? No, no, this is not the top yet because as soon as season ends, then everyone dives in to indices and learnings.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did we learn? What surprised us? What questions did we think we're going to get answered but didnt? But those are actually my two favorite things from retros. And then maybe, you know, maybe a little bit in June and July, people take vacation. The crazy thing, though, is that for as fast as you work, it's fun. Because you see, this is the beauty of agile you see very quickly the impact that you had as a one human that you have on how people all got their job done of taxes, right? So you literally made a difference in a very tangible way to people's lives. That feels great because that's what gets me up in the morning. And then you also see how it benefited the company overall.

And I realized, oh, I don't have a couple of months, I have four, I have four weeks, OK? And then I readjusted my perspective, and I thought, well, I bet I can beat that. So I launched it in two weeks, I got off the ground and VP. And I do remember the moment where it flipped inside me. And I was like, I don't care whose job it is, I'm gonna fill the gap. I'm going to ping the project manager, I'm going to talk to the partner, I'm going to make it happen, I'm going to own this thing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I do remember pulling my boss and my director, and Monday morning when I realized like, oh, we have a little bit of time. I just looked at him. And I said, I'm committed to beating this deadline. So let's get aligned and make it happen. And it was a blast. But agile into it. Oh my goodness, that that goes back, honestly, to the very beginning with Scott Cook, they've really always worked that way before agile was the thing they worked that way, if you look and Scott Cook's original business plan, he's like measuring the data. Here's, here's what we're aiming for, for timesavers because Quicken was the original product, here's where we're going.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then they worked and worked and worked, they solve the big hairy problem, got the MVP out there. And it was incredibly fast that they became the market leader. And how what had happened was they had a home product that they were asking people, how are you utilizing this product at that, you know, like Where where are you utilizing it. And people kept saying they were using it at work. And they thought, well, they must be doing their personal finances in the office or something, have a home office, and found out that that wasn't the case. It was a bunch of regular people, small business owners who didn't understand debit and credit accounting. So they used, you know, the Intuit product. And out of the curiosity of why are people saying that the expansion, all the various products that Intuit has created and built over the years really came from those principles that Scott Cook laid out, probably when I was a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBalancing Agile Innovation with Consistency in Customer Experience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eRight? I think this kind of brings everything together this question, you know, because there's always the balancing act of the desire to roll things out fast and be quick and be ahead of competitors, with the urge to stay with the tried and true that your data tells you works every year. So I guess to kind of bring it all home, how do you go about balancing that need for agility, and experimentation with maintaining all that consistency and continuity in the customer experience that your consumers and prospects have come to expect?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarietta:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, when you read a newspaper, you can read any newspaper across the US. And they're all going to have the same basic serif font with a large cap that tells you this is the beginning of the paragraph. And they're all going to have the same basic typesetting and you probably don't notice it, or you probably do, Dom, but most people don't notice it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's almost invisible. But it's very purposeful. And it has trained us. It's like the grammar, or the etiquette of how newspapers work, and Apple did the same kind of thing, they came up with this etiquette, well, Intuit has this internal product etiquette that everything has to adhere to. So we keep it in that space for customers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when you come in, you don't go, oh, my you totally redone everything, I can't find the button anymore. Right? So that's very intentional, and the customer focus that is embedded at every level, like, you can hardly have a business meeting without saying, what's the customer problem we're solving, let's get crisp on that. What is the thing and it's truly incorporated in everything. So in that process, where you're prototyping with customers, you're observing them, you're keeping yourself out of the process, you're really truly observing how they get the job done of doing taxes, you see, if they compensate for something, that to them, that seems really natural and logical, you know, how they're doing it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you know, it's like five steps that they don't need to do. So we get in front of that stuff that pain. And we do, ask ourselves, what will the impact be on the customer? Will they have to do anything different? Are they gaining? Are they going to in any way lose any functionality or capability, or anything that they're used to having? So there was a product that people use to track their donations and different things like that expenses, and it's a little freebie, and we were gonna sunset it. We didn't think it drove that much value. Boy, we heard back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eThat's the best customer experience test right there. Take something away, and really see what your feedback you get you. Sometimes you solicit feedback, right? You email them, you call them, you make them do a survey. Well, hey, let's just good old fashioned, rip it apart, and then see what happens.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarietta:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, we just said, Hey, we're gonna take it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Oh, OK. You want?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarietta:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, yeah, that that ended very quickly. And it's still there to this day operating away. Happily.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDeveloping Successful CX Strategies\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. And that's probably an example of, like you said earlier, we didn't take ourselves out of it. We saw something that we think needed to go away because it wasn't provided. I'm sure the analytics were there. Right, the ROI wasn't there. You know, that kind of thing. But you had that customer demand, nope, nope, nope? No, keep it and you're like, okay,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarietta: \u003c/strong\u003eOK. Yes, ma'am.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eGot it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarietta:\u003c/strong\u003e Exactly. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e I love it.

That's pretty impressive. Okay, good. Well, the good news is we got very affable guests here with us to put us all at ease and talk about high level customer experience stuff because this guy has the background for it. He's been there done that. Today, we are going to be joined by Cary Cusumano, former customer experience design consultant at Verizon, spending good chunk of his time now, as a CMSWire contributor. Cary, welcome.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCary Cusumano: \u003c/strong\u003eHey, Dom, it's always nice to be with you guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah:\u003c/strong\u003e Cary, I'm happy because you're one of the contributors that I found. So it's great to have you. Yes, yes. And I hear you're going to be talking about what's in your CX toolbox. And before we get into the world of CX, we do want to know more about you. So what are you focusing on right now in CX? And what are your past roles that led you to where you are today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCary: \u003c/strong\u003eMy hope here from this podcast is that a couple of takeaways will be just key attributes that a CX professional will want to have in their toolbox. Not necessarily the the actual tools themselves, but the capabilities or the skills that they want to take away with themselves. So hopefully, I'll leave a little bit of that for your audience.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd people will be interested in finding out more to answer your second question. Basically, I started out in the United States Navy was my first quote unquote real job, where I qualified in submarines and ultimately became a chief engineer in the nuclear power plant. So it felt to me like my first move into the civilian world was a natural, windowed stay in engineering and operations. And that's kind of what I did. I worked at a company that's no longer in existence called MCI, telecom company. But the key there was these were roles that were, again, engineering, network design, network implementation, video conferencing, things like that. But you know what the other thing that I found here, Sarah, was where I learned the most about the business was in some chief of staff roles, where now you're seeing everything across marketing and finance, and HR, et cetera.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in those roles, one thing that started to come to the fore, in my mind was seeing the same types of issues arise over and over and I developed a curiosity to kind of say, Why did these same things keep happening, whether that was in finance, or whether it was in a technical area, problem solving, Eric troubleshooting for the customers, there just seem to be the same types of issues that were process related. And so one of the things that I that I actually have, that personally, I like, is the investigative aspect of problem solving. So it's this notion of trying to dig under why things happen. And I guess when you combine these elements here, it really became a foundational core of what I think is a key attribute for CX professionals that haven't that's just a general curiosity about why and then that persistence in the investigation of why processes go sideways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd once again, we have a CX leader, who took such a traditional route to the CX path, the Navy, right? Isn't that, it's fascinating to me, we've had architects, we've had engineers, math whiz, and all of a sudden, they end up as CX leaders like I find this so fascinating, by the way, thank you for your service, number one. And number two, how does that path emerge, It's nuts?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCary:\u003c/strong\u003e It's funny that you probably hear me chuckle because I remember one comment from one of my commanding officers at one point, he said, originality is neither required nor desired. And I was a little bit of resistant to that notion, but I guess when you're operating a nuclear power plant, you want to stick to the rules that would be fundamental.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYou would think so. Cool. Yeah. Always be in monitor there for sure. All right. So let's get into the talk. So you know, talking about the CX toolbox for practical measurable outcomes, the key attributes of CX professional needs for success. So question number one, you began your career with several operations engineering, even chief of staff of roles, again, getting into this whole evolution into CX, what was the true spark that led you to CX management?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCary:\u003c/strong\u003e Like I said, in those particular roles, what I found was a recurrence of the same types of problems that got me looking at this notion of continuous process management, particularly in the field that I studied was in Lean Six Sigma, you could be in TQM, total quality management, could be Lean Six Sigma, it doesn't matter, the method, as long as you have some type of focus on continuous process improvement. And so I basically went and became a certified Lean Six Sigma, but though, using those skills to try and get underneath why things were happening, and actually solve problems once you understand the root causes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/align-your-voice-of-the-customer-initiative-with-your-customers/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Align Your Voice of the Customer Initiative With Your Customers\"\u003eAlign Your Voice of the Customer Initiative With Your Customers\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDecoding the Value of 'Voice of the Customer' in Business Success\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and I definitely agree, there's certainly, you know, enormous value to businesses that practice these sorts of process improvements. But that doesn't sound like it's exactly CX. So could you connect the dots a little bit more for us,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eSara, with the hard hitting questions, usually, yeah, but is it CX related, dude, I love it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCary: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's a good question. It's a fair question, Sarah. And the reality is that there's essentially in a Lean Six Sigma project, you have five phases. And the first of those phases is called the Define Phase, which is really about justifying why you're going to enter into a project in the first place.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the things I learned from one of my trainers was the question of the Define Phase is what is important. And so obviously, there is a financial element to entering any type of particular process improvement project, whether that's a cost savings, focus, whether it's a revenue, uplift focus. But one of the other elements that had to be done was this notion, again, at the time, I was learning this notion of what is voice the customer, and voice the customer to us at the time really amounted to some survey scores, we were getting Net Promoter scores for various elements or aspects of the service that we were delivering. Occasionally, you would get a verbatim response that helped you get a little bit underneath it. But to us, that's what voice of the customer was.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was essential as a part of justifying why he's particularly did a project. And the problem that I noticed, again, after having done several projects was at the end of a project. We were always asked, How much money did you save or how much revenue? But we were never asked, How did this \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2023/03/using-technology-to-create-a-better-customer-experience\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"improve the customer experience\"\u003eimprove the customer experience\u003c/a\u003e. And of course, there was a small team of us, I would say, maybe three of us at most, who walked away with the same thought that this notion of voice the customer, we believe in it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it seems like it was a slide on your define meeting that got promptly shoved in a drawer and forgotten about. And so the three of us essentially made it our mission to raise awareness for this notion of voice of the customer and make ourselves experts in analyzing it, I guess then that might actually include a second attribute, which would be, let's start with voice of the customer as the centerpiece of anything we're doing that affects the customer experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e So with those folks, you know, in the past, who were talking about the financial aspect, and oh, what was the financial outcome of this? How much did we make? How much do we save? Were you able to convince those folks eventually, about the customer experience, impact and get them to be sort of believers in that and not hitting in the drawer, as you said, and how so if you were able to convince them to buy in there?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCary:\u003c/strong\u003e You know, Dom, I think that we eventually did, but it wasn't like an overnight thing. It was something that took us a little bit of time. And it really, I think grew out of this small cadre of folks who again, we made it our mission, to bring this notion of voice of the customer to the fore. One of my colleagues, for example, he decided to make himself an expert on survey design, because, as you guys know, this particular audience, that you have your time as well knows that, oftentimes, that's how you ask the question on a survey that's important.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went off to Medallia as a consultant there and became an expert on survey design, and sharing his knowledge with clients of his own. A second colleague in this small group of ours, she went on to Verizon, executive response team, and basically you and I know that when I send a complaint letter to the CEO of, let's say, Navy Federal Credit Union, for example, which I did at one point, they never see that. It really goes to a small team.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this is what my colleague was doing was receiving and reading customer complaint letters, and she got to a point where the volume was so high, she needed to give herself a tool to sift through that data at a little higher volume. So she began to make herself an expert in text more Particularly with Clarabridge, some of your audience may be familiar with that tool doesn't matter again, what the tool was. This is what she used to become an expert in text analytics and start to find patterns.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, for myself, I went to a conference where I saw a gentleman from General Motors speak named David Mingle. And this became, I think, a turning point in where I wanted to make myself an expert. He talked about how Mary Barra, their CEO would spend about an hour each week, listening to customer calls and their call center, listen them directly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that way, she got to hear firsthand, the voice of the customer, literally the voice that customer not only reading it on paper, this prompted me to say, Listen, you know, we record every one of our calls in our service centers. But our executive management team was not co-located with a call center, there was no way to get them into there. So I thought, maybe I can bring it to them. So I made myself an expert on the voice analytics, and I was using Verint. Again, there's a number of tools out there, but again, using the analytical capability of this voice software, to dig deeper into why customers were calling in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah: \u003c/strong\u003eSo as someone who's not a sales professional, I'm always on the opposite side of customer business interactions, like I am always the customer, I'm never the provider. And sometimes it feels like these businesses can forget that they're also customers. So do you think today's practitioners still have to make a case for voice of the customer? Or do you think times have changed in most corporate environments?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCary: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know, Sarah, I think it's even more important now. I don't know what to attribute it to, I don't know whether the COVID pandemic has become an easy scapegoat for a lot of issues. But I am finding, and I don't know if you are as well, that customer service, and customer experience in general has declined over the last few years. I feel like brands are much more married to the process than they are to the customer themselves.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so you'll find this, again, I mentioned having to write to the CEO of Navy Federal Credit Union because I had an important check held up, which I needed to close on a house purchase, and it was going to cause me to be delayed, when I called into the service center, it really reduced to sorry, nothing we can do. That's the process, you're just gonna have to wait it out. And at the end of the day, what ended up happening was, sure enough, I got a call from somebody in their executor response team says, I've already got your problem solved.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, if you think about it, Sarah, anybody could have solved that problem. If those frontline service people were empowered to solve it. This is where again, I think, Sarah, that this notion of process, or customers has taken hold, had these people been empowered to solve the problem in the first place. They knew what exactly needed to be done. They just weren't empowered as the frontline service people to do that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I sympathize with you, I've experienced it myself, you bring to mind something that a colleague of mine says, says Cary why do people behave differently in the office than they do at home? And what he means is exactly what you just said, Sarah, is when we're the recipient of the experience, we recognize a bad one immediately. But when we're on the business side delivering it, we kind of get a little bit of a cognitive dissonance about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/9-enterprise-voice-of-the-customer-voc-tools-you-should-know-about/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"10 Voice of the Customer Tools to Maximize Customer Experience\"\u003e10 Voice of the Customer Tools to Maximize Customer Experience\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eUnraveling Customer Journey: Root Cause Analysis Drives CX and Saves Money\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah:\u003c/strong\u003e Right? No, I completely agree. And it seems like as well, the voice of the customer is a big undertaking, because I recently wrote an article for CMSWire, about customer metrics. And it seems like there's so many volumes of data that can just be overwhelming. And you might not know where to begin when you have to start addressing customer needs. So I was wondering, how do you solve that problem? Can you solve that problem?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCary: \u003c/strong\u003eWell,Sarah, it's a legitimate question, because it's one thing to be, you know, reviewing survey responses. And you know, one of the reasons that this small team of us moved beyond just surveys was listen, what do you do with an eight? What do you do with a six? What do you do with a four? The number itself doesn't help you understand what is underneath this? And this is why, you know, again, the three of us gravitated toward things that I will call this unstructured, and particularly unsolicited voice of the customer, this notion that customers when they're answering the survey that you've sent them, they're really just responding to something that you think is important, but when they're calling and when their email or know when they're chatting online. That's what's on their mind.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it gets to the core of the question that you're asking here is, boy, now you're dealing with large volumes, because at best, you should be delighted if you get a 5% response rate on customer surveys. Many people just you know, give them wave of the hand and pass them off. But of course, if you're recording all your calls, if you're keeping a log of all your chat transcripts, you have 100% of that data and is a very powerful source of data from which you can find those root causes we talked about earlier.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the way, now, this reminds me this, this becomes probably another attribute that I would say a CX professional has to have met is go beyond just the traditional methods of looking at surveys, or maybe even reading some verbatim comments on those surveys, go out and find the unstructured the unsolicited sources that will give you a large volume and very meaningful data to work from. Now, going deeper into your question. What had happened was, and this goes back Dom to a question you asked earlier, how did you get the executives on board, what I was doing with this information was, I learned quickly that you don't have to bother with a five minute call, that's probably a password reset, you're not bothered with a 10 minute call, that's an address change or something like that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou had to suffer through the 45 minute call or the hour and 15 minute long call, to really understand why the customer was experiencing pain, that's where the pain really was, was in these long ones, where it became a dialogue back and forth. You know, and recognizing that you're trying to get this in front of an executive, you're not going to share an hour and 15 minutes with the call up.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was condensing them, clipping them down to about two or three minute segments, sharing them with executives, and the rest of my colleagues within the team. And then one day, one of those particular calls I shared, my friend who had gone over the to the executive response team, she called me up and she said, Cary, this is crazy. Because remember, you know, we had tens of thousands of business customers in Verizon, she said, Cary, I have an email from this exact same customer that you just sent the cal on. And we just said, you know, that's kind of funny. Wouldn't it be neat if we could sort of reconstruct their journey from other sources of voice of the customer.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd sure enough, we found out, by the way, that the call that I found was not the first call that that customer made they actually called another center, we found a few points of data within our operating support systems and were able to kind of reconstruct that customer's actual journey, not typical journey map, which again, it's very important and needed in business. But this was the actual journey that this particular customer experienced. It was something that, again, this notion of having a persistence in investigation led me to say, you know, what are the places can we look at, we can look at social media, we can look at Better Business Bureau reports, we can look at chat transcripts, we can look at emails, we can also go look in our own CRMs. And we can look in our trouble management systems, our billing system to find out the elements that even when the customer didn't know it, were affecting their journey.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I think what this enabled us to do was isolate root causes through the reconstruction of these actual journeys. And I'll give you an example how that happened. Many of the calls that I heard, had a common theme, and that was I've got a bill that I don't recognize. And a lot of businesses might say, Okay, let's start a project, we have the root cause here billing clarity and billing accuracy. But by reconstructing the actual journey, yet till you got to a root cause it had nothing to do with billing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, one of the cases was, we had a third party vendor operating on our behalf. That was selling services to customers that weren't compatible with their equipment. And again, it was just a simple mistake, they didn't know. But we changed the process for that vendor. And guess what just happened there, Dom and Sarah, you took the root cause away? And how many calls did we get after that? Zero, multiply that again by another four vendors that we found that were doing the same thing with just a simple mistake. And now you can see the power and the scalability of using voice the customer data to isolate and eliminate root causes that are causing bad experiences. Oh, and by the way, it also saves you money, because now you're not fielding those phone calls. That's a pretty good deal, isn't it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e There you go. Now you're speaking the executives’ language. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCary: \u003c/strong\u003eExactly. And that's one thing, Dom, that really catches their attention, you know, the same executive on an another root cause from a billing problem, he realized that one particular configuration of the product we were selling was broken. And he had the courage to say stop selling that product, you're damaging the brand. It took about a month, you know, we fixed the root causes underneath that, and then we're able to sell that particular configuration again. But I would submit to you, Dom and Sarah, that thinkers, like that particular executive are rare because it's a courageous thing to say, I'm going to close off a portion of my revenue stream temporarily so that I get it right on behalf of my customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/voice-of-the-customer-voc-much-more-than-a-satisfied-customer/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Voice of the Customer (VoC): Much More Than a Satisfied Customer\"\u003eVoice of the Customer (VoC): Much More Than a Satisfied Customer\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eExpand Closed-Loop Feedback to Enhance CX Strategy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and also I mean, not to mention the other executive you mentioned too, that was listening to the call center calls that's above and beyond, right for an executive that's like a VP of CX or chief customer officers. Dream boss. no?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCary:\u003c/strong\u003e Exactly. And I would tell you, from the lessons that we learned, again, hearing about that GM executive, and seeing the results from my own, one of the things I would recommend to CX practitioners, it's a kind of an uphill battle. But if they could get their executive teams, not just the C-level, folks, but just like you said, VPs, and senior directors, to make it a point doesn't have to actually be listening to phone calls, it can be reading chat transcripts, or reading emails that are coming here in customers pain in their own words, and again, not responding simply to a survey, where they're answering something that we think is important, listen to what these customers are saying in their own words about the pain they're experiencing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eExactly. So if you could kind of like bring it home, like if we were to encapsulate your experience with CX organizations being the CX leadership role, designing their own strategy, what would be your advice for designing their own strategy when it comes to all this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCary: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, one of the first things I think that makes a customer experience program complete is this notion of closed loop feedback, many of your audience probably is very well familiar with this, and those that are doing it, they're probably very adept at the idea of a customer called in or wrote in with a complaint, we opened a ticket, we found out what caused that problem, we resolved the problem, maybe even did a brief project to find a root cause behind it. And then we close the loop by getting back to the customer expressing, hey, listen, our bad here, we're sorry, that your experience with our product with our service, whatever it might be, we're sorry that that was a bad one, we've resolved the problem, we want to make sure that we close that loop with you.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrands that are doing closed loop are generally doing that part, some of them better than others. But the one element of closed loop that I find a lot of brands are missing is this whole notion that I just talked through. And that's the how do I take the volumes of complaint data or volumes of questions that come in? They can just be informational questions. And I'm saying Listen, why am I taking such a high volume of them? Maybe I can offer my customers a way to find this information out in an easier way? How do they take these large volumes of data and say, what is the root cause underneath this? How do I find a way maybe to do a project to take that root cause out so that the customers never experienced it in the first place? So I guess, you know, if there was one key attribute that I would take from that notion, not even just for individuals, but for CX teams, is to expand your closed loop feedback processes, to include this element of re-using and re-looking at the larger volume of complaints over time to say, You know what, we've got a pattern here. Let's dig underneath that and find out how we can remove the root cause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd since we're at the end of the discussion, I wanted to ask you if you had any singular takeaway that you'd like to offer for CX leaders that are diving into the voice of the customer, or just anything in the CX space that you want to share with the audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eCary, how about the job of Sarah Butkovic on her debut?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCary: \u003c/strong\u003eSara is asking the right questions. And she's asking the challenging questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. And she's making calls on like, when the show is going to answer like, All right, we've come to the end of the discussion. We've gotten enough out of this guy, this guy has given us so many good tips. Let's end it while he's hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCary:\u003c/strong\u003e Exactly. And I think to answer the question for you, Sarah, is this notion of doing in fact, if you look at my LinkedIn profile, you see a lot of folks who are thought leaders, but I actually my profiles is CX doing leader. And that's really what I think I would leave them with Sarah is OK. A lot of folks are collecting voice of the customer data. They're publishing Net Promoter Score for their executives. Oftentimes, they're hoping that NPS changes just because they're measuring it. And to directly answer your question, take that information and do something with it. Use the information that you're collecting the voice of the customer program, as a component of your overall CX program, to say, how do I solve problems, make the root causes go away, so the customer has never experienced them in the first place?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Well said, way to end it, Sarah, thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah: \u003c/strong\u003eThank you.

She acknowledges the transformative potential of AI and its capacity to fundamentally alter the landscape of various industries. At the same time, she highlights the resistance this technology faces from certain quarters. The discussion extends to exploring the ethical conundrums posed by AI, emphasizing its potential to disrupt traditional job roles and intensify the fear of human downsizing, a concern particularly felt for creative roles. Henderson underscores the urgent need for organizations to establish their own codes of ethics in this nascent and rapidly evolving field, where concrete legal and ethical guidelines are yet to be standardized. She advocates for a proactive approach in embracing this technological advancement, emphasizing that the strategic integration of AI can secure a business's place in the future of customer experience and other creative endeavors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe caught up with Brianna recently on the topic.\u003c/p\u003e","transcriptHtml":"\u003ch3\u003eThe Gist\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAI impact. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eGenerative AI is revolutionizing industries, but also raising resistance.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEthical concerns.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eNew tech sparks questions around privacy and legal implications.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJob evolution. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAI could transition the jobs of creatives.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOrganizational adaptation. \u003cem\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eEthical AI use and risk assessment will be crucial.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTime-saving capacity. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAI can take care of monotonous tasks and save time so that workers can focus on higher level tasks.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmbracing change. \u003c/strong\u003eA\u003cem\u003eccepting and integrating AI into our worklives is a better path than fighting technological progress.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis transcript has been edited for clarity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom Nicastro:\u003c/strong\u003e Hello, everybody, Dom Nicastro here, managing editor of CMSWire back for another round of CX Decoded. And today, I nabbed another one. I nabbed the practitioner in the world of CX. I love it. Here she is Brianna Langley Henderson, regional customer experience manager for \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://careers.wasteconnections.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Waste Connections\"\u003eWaste Connections\u003c/a\u003e, but forget that title because she's also a CMSWire contributor. What's going on Brianna?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna Langley Henderson:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, forget everything else in my life. And nothing up until this point has meant anything. I also write articles for CMSWire now. I'm good. I'm good. I'm glad to be here. Glad to be talking to you today, for sure.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eWe are happy to have you, you, you know been about a year now. So really, of just cranking out some copy for CMSWire, and our contributors are those in the trenches, you know, doing the work of CX marketing. I love getting practitioners, honestly, because you're doing the work, and you're living it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd I feel like CX is still a new enough field that we're all just really excited when people care about and want to talk to us about it. So I hope I can speak for my fellow practitioners when I say that, but I'm always happy to talk about this stuff.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eExploring the Role of Generative AI in Customer Experience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. And now this is such an exciting time because Brianna, you and I get excited about things like \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/9-enterprise-voice-of-the-customer-voc-tools-you-should-know-about/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"voice of the customer\"\u003evoice of the customer\u003c/a\u003e and CSAT. And now this monster has come in in the form of generative artificial intelligence. And all of us are thinking, what are we going to do with this for CX? How are we going to implement it? Where can we start? What are the early wins? So that's what we're going to focus on today. But before we get into that, I just want our listeners to get a little bit more insights into Brianna. So tell us how you got in the role you're currently serving? What's your gig all about? And kind of the evolution of how you arrived there?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna:\u003c/strong\u003e My story is probably pretty similar to a lot of CX practitioners. But I started out not in CX, believe it or not.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eI'm telling you, I hear that more than you think like, yeah, I was an engineer. And you know, I was an architect. And then I do voice the customer now.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, exactly. Not an engineer and architect. But I did go to school for journalism. And I double majored in international affairs. So definitely a little more political science than marketing. But ironically, my first big girl job out of college was in marketing. And then after that, I was in PR for a couple of years. So I've seen both sides of that communications coin. And CX kind of happened to me, honestly, I was in the market for a job and I saw a job that was inappropriately labeled. My manager at the time would agree with me that it was inappropriately labeled because they didn't have a word for it. And they didn't know what to call it. But it was definitely it was marketed as a digital marketing job. So I applied and ended up getting it, and I now work for this awesome company. But we definitely changed the title pretty quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause as you know, customer experience encompasses just so much more than straight up digital marketing. So it was a decision that was made right off the bat to make that title a little bit broader. But yeah, now here I am.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eAll right. So we got the backstory. That's great. Now, November 2022, November 2022 is the month. I think it's November 30. Actually, that \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/chatgpt-what-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ChatGPT\"\u003eChatGPT\u003c/a\u003e debuted, OpenAI is wildly popular, fastest growing app of all time. Chatbot. And so that comes into play. Bring me back then, what as a CX leader were you doing in the early days there, like kind of testing things out? Or are you just putting in things like, spark a debate about peanut butter and jelly between Obama and Trump? That's what I was doing in the beginning. I don't know what you were doing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, that's funny. We actually here at my company, we don't use \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/15/tech/sam-altman-openai/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/15/tech/sam-altman-openai/index.html\"\u003eChatGPT\u003c/a\u003e. But we use something very, very similar. So we do use a generative AI content generating platform that is super similar. I am — when we first discovered it, I do remember some of the silly, silly tests and stuff we would run. I think we wrote a country song in the voices of Willie Nelson as a team, and just things like that to see what it could do. Honestly, it's not been that long since it's been released. And I think that that's an indicator of what a game-changer it is, is that it has come such a long way in such a short amount of time. The idea of it I think, in the beginning was what really captured a lot of people's attention and now all those things that we were talking about, Oh, I wonder if this will be possible eventually, back when this was first being talked about are suddenly possible. Like we have, we have boots on the ground sales campaigns here. And one of the more you know, non-obvious things you can use this type of software for is creating super simple, super streamlined routes for our salespeople.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just things like that, that I think you think automatically about blog posts and social media content, things like that. But the more advanced this thing has gotten, the more we've been able to get a lot of less obvious use cases out of it, which has been super helpful.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so you guys were ahead of the game in that sense. So you are already implementing, had already infused generative AI before the whole ChatGPT phenomenon.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna:\u003c/strong\u003e Actually, yes. I remember reading the first article that I saw on ChatGPT. And I was kind of like, that sounds really similar to you saying that's interesting.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Waste Connections was on point.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna: \u003c/strong\u003eI know. Yeah, well, technically, if we're just talking chat, GPT. I'm not an expert. Not super familiar. But if we're talking about generative AI in general, I definitely have some notches in my belt, and I'm happy to contribute any kind of knowledge I can, which is limited because I think it is still growing. And it is still very new. And so I think, for everybody, we're still all learning this thing and how it can really be utilized to its fullest potential.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/generative-ai-opportunities-and-challenges-for-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Generative AI: Opportunities and Challenges for Marketing\"\u003eGenerative AI: Opportunities and Challenges for Marketing\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSelecting and Implementing AI\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Were you involved in the whole which platform you're gonna use?

The longer answer is at the time we were working with a contractor who we had hired, actually, I believe we hired him originally to do some photography work for us. He threw the name of the software out there. And I'll just say it. I mean, they don't sponsor us. But it's Jasper, \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/totango-jasperai-unite-to-offer-new-generative-ai-cx-features/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jasper AI\"\u003eJasper AI\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e A very popular tool.

And I was working on some copywriting, I believe, and he just kind of threw it out there to me, he threw it out to me, Hey, have you ever tried this Jasper thing? I think you would really like it. And so I brought it to our CIO and the rest of the team. And we ended up incorporating it. So it all thanks to a contract and photographer that I haven't seen in a very long time. But here we are.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. So so the early use cases, what were they? What was implementation like, you know, did it have to communicate with other existing internal systems? That's a big deal when you when you're choosing any kind of software that's going to get into the marketing, customer experience ecosystems, like, does it even work with what we have already?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna:\u003c/strong\u003e OK, so I will tell you a story. And it’s a little bit of a personal story. But for me, personally, I was like, on board with this thing from the beginning. Because I hate mundane tasks. This story that I'm about to tell you is what made me want to kiss the feet of generative AI because I cannot handle having to do the same monotonous thing over and over again. But way back when, June of 2021, I believe is when our organization first undertook just this massive project to migrate all of our websites, to a brand new hosting platform.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor those of you who aren't familiar so much with our business model, we are a very decentralized company. So that means that all of our local sites need their own local websites, most of them have chosen to retain their pre-acquisition, local branding. Okay, so we're kind of sneaky in that way. Right. So there's like a ton of waste and recycling companies out there that we own, that you would never know because there's no words, Waste Connections in their name anywhere at all. But all that to say the branding for 95% of these local sites had to remain unique throughout the whole migration process. And just to put in perspective, we have well over 500 or so just locally branded sites. So you can imagine what an undertaking that was. And in the beginning, it was really an all hands on deck situation for a long time. So we had IT, we had the web dev team helping, obviously CX, you name it, we were all just kind of helping to chip away at this huge effort.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, we put yourself in brand willingly Henderson shoes, the person who absolutely hates mundane work and mundane and monotonous things.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/where-are-marketers-on-the-generative-ai-adoption-curve/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Where Are Marketers on the Generative AI Adoption Curve?\"\u003eWhere Are Marketers on the Generative AI Adoption Curve?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAdapting to AI and Utilizing Its Efficiency\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eI'm with you, by the way, I'm with you. They're like I'm an editor, right? I'm supposed to be having fun, creating content, talking with reporters about how we're gonna approach a story. Anytime someone makes me do something like you got to fill in that data cell in Excel. I get mad at them like no, I don't. Why? I’m better than this, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna:\u003c/strong\u003e And I know there are people out there who love coming into work every morning knowing exactly what they're going to be doing and God bless them because I'm truly grateful that those people exist because I couldn't do it. Can't do it. But imagine having to write that many unique SEO related page descriptions for that many websites, or that many image alt tags or like even just website copy in general, honestly, there's only so much you can say about waste and recycling in a different way every single time, right? So it just became very, very monotonous.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was the first thing I thought of when this software was presented to me. And so I was really hyping it up to our CIO, especially in the beginning, which I don't regret at all, because it has been a lifesaver. Like, literally since that time, I don't think I've written a single page description on my own. It's all been our AI software. And so for things like that, it's so incredibly useful.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, very smart. So that's a huge undertaking. I mean, we all know how much of a bear that is to get the websites uploaded, distinguished, different logos, different product descriptions, different links to cities and towns by laws. And let's not forget, people, when they go to a trash website, what do they want? They want quick, easy information.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna: \u003c/strong\u003eExactly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e No, they want to know, the day they throw out the trash. They want to know when the yard waste state starts. When other Christmas tree dumps, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, like that. You're a pro. Listen, you\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I'm all about the trash. For real. I went to my city and town government website. I think I was in a new town as of a year ago. That's what I did. But back to the generative AI thing. So that was a huge, early win.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. For me personally, and I think for the rest of the team as well. I mean, even people who love monotonous things, 500 sites is a lot.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna:\u003c/strong\u003e So it was it was definitely one of the early ones. And again, since then, not only have we been able to explore it more and really what it's capable of, but it's become capable of so much more. I want to say that was summer of 2022 When we first adopted this thing, so it's really kind of taken on a whole new life and a whole new level of helpfulness.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, the efficiency for me, too, as an editor, reporter writer, the efficiency is the big win for me early, right. I wouldn't say like I know how to write now. No, I kind of knew how to write before AI came into the picture.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna:\u003c/strong\u003e You did.

My question to you of how great it was at the beginning. Were there any drawbacks though, because I will tell you this, I got burned once, oh I'm going to be so clever and efficient today. So I put a contributors article into ChatGPT. And I said, Give me a LinkedIn post about this. Right, I'm busy, I wanted to put it on LinkedIn. So I did write all looks great. And the contributor said, OK, not quite what I was going for in the article, Dom, I'm like, You know what, you're right. I reread it, I'm like, that's a little off. So were there anything like that that came up? Were you so efficient, you rolled it out, but then you went back and said, Ooh, that's might be a little off.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna:\u003c/strong\u003e I think now, at least my team, we've kind of found our rhythm with it. And I really love what you said about efficiency and time saving, because that's really where the benefits are. And if you try to use it for much beyond that is, that's when you're gonna get burned, right? Because I'm telling you, we crank out now twice the amount of content as we did before. So whether you're talking about LinkedIn posts or website copy, even PR pitches, we could never have had the bandwidth to really do what we've done now before.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I really like to approach the system as a whole. And when I say that, I mean, the generative AI piece and the human element of it. So I've said pretty much from the beginning, I want to look at this in terms of quantity and quality. So when you use the AI piece to generate your quantity, right, you have more of the human capital and human energy to be able to focus on the quality of what you're putting out into the world. So when you kind of approach it as an all in one machine, for lack of a better word, it really becomes more of a win win situation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo while the AI is cranking out kind of the skeletal content, we have our amazing humans, fleshing it out and editing it and tweaking it and making it just so before we send it out into the world. So then at the end of the day, you end up with both higher quantities and higher quality content. Whereas before at least for us, it was often a case of having to choose one over the other because we only have so much bandwidth right? So the results have been really quite amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have to harness it as a whole concept. And as a singular system in that way, I don't think you can really separate the AI from the humans too much without getting into trouble.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know what I look at AI as it's an intern, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's the best intern ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eBring coffee to Yeah, no, that's the only thing. But it also doesn't take the last slice of cake in the office, though. So that's a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo this compare and contrast. But if you look at it as an intern, for real, everyone loves the intern, they do so much. They take things off your plate, those mundane tasks that you hate. But at the end of the day, when the intern puts something out there, that's going to be public facing right, you're like, Okay, let's give us a look. Let's give us a quick look, right? Because they're young, they're trying to impress, and they don't have that institutional company or customer knowledge quite yet. They're learning. So interns are constantly scrutinized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo ever since that LinkedIn post, which is a big lesson for me, I adapt that mindset. I use AI very frequently, but I always give it that human check. Last minute thing? For sure.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, you got to I mean, at the end of the day, it is a robot. And so yeah, I think that's a really helpful way to look at it like an intern.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e And I want marketers customer experience people like you to envision and see how that implementation went, because I think it's a big part of OK, there were some successes there. Of course, you doubled your content, you a quicker, 500 websites is no joke. Was that a heavy lift, actually implementing that AI tool, that generative AI tool to integrate with your website? Was that like an IT job? Or was it something like the average marketer or customer experience professional can kind of just do?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna: \u003c/strong\u003eSo for us, I think it's a little bit different, because we do have very unsilent teams. So the person I had to bring this to was our CIO, who's obviously over our IT department. So from the beginning, we were all kind of aligned in the direction that we were going. But if it was the more siloed situation, and it was just a marketing department or just the CX department. For us, it wasn't really a heavy lift. But that being said, if you're talking specifically ChatGPT, I have no idea with, with Jasper AI, they made it very, very easy. And it seems like it's very integratable with a lot of different software's and things like that. So for us, it hasn't been that part of it at least hasn't been too difficult.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I don't want to get too philosophical with this or anything. But I'm kind of hoping that that's what ends up happening as a result of this, I think that the more evolved AI becomes, the more we've really got to figure out how to work together better. And I don't just mean with the AI itself, but also with each other, right cross departmentally, we've got to break down those silos because, and this is gonna sound way more dramatic than what I necessarily mean. But it's kind of like the old mantra, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Right? And I definitely don't think AI is our enemy. Not really.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I'm very much hoping that the rise of this new tech does bring it into some of the, you know, internal competition we might feel towards other humans in our organization, or even just those silos I was talking about earlier, because I'm hoping that this technical evolution brings humans all a little bit closer, because we really do all need to have a voice at the table when it comes to generating content that's meant to represent an entire organization using robots, right? I mean, if we aren't all aligned when it comes to something like that, I'm afraid. That's when we'll see the breakdown of internal communication start to erode. And that leads to serious gaps in customer facing communication, which can be devastating, ultimately.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo anyway, I know that doesn't really answer the question you're asking. But I think the more human hands that we can get into the AI pot, the better off the entire organization will be in general, for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/break-the-ai-blame-cycle-user-responsibility-in-the-generative-ai-age/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Break the AI Blame Cycle: User Responsibility in the Generative AI Age\"\u003eBreak the AI Blame Cycle: User Responsibility in the Generative AI Age\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eGrappling with Game-Changing Advancements \u0026amp; Ethical Challenges\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's super weird, like generative AI to me is super weird. Advancement. On one hand, it's so phenomenally game-changing, right? On the other hand, there are people trying to stop the creation of it. Okay, you have thousands of high level AI players and Elon Musk, trying to actually stop these big AI laboratories from doing any more development. They literally signed a petition. There's a policy group in Washington that wrote to the FTC, that literally they should pretty much shut down open AI, which created ChatGPT. So sometimes, Brianna, I feel when I'm using it, I feel like I'm using a drug that's going to be illegal next month. It's got that odd contrast to me that so \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/generative-ai-opportunities-and-challenges-for-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"you wrote a great column for us March 6\"\u003eyou wrote a great column for us March 6\u003c/a\u003e, talking about the challenges and the opportunities. We know what the opportunity You've laid that out very well with your use case with the website. Talk about some of the challenges now that you brought up in that column, like ethical questions, that kind of thing. What What kind of sparked that column?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know, we can talk about privacy issues, and we can talk about legal ramifications. And we can talk about all of that stuff. Honestly, I personally don't think there's much to talk about in that arena yet, except to say, organizations are going to have to kind of come up with their own codes of ethics right now, because it is still so new, that there hasn't been a lot of precedent set. I think the underlying fear though, and we're really going to get to the heart of the concern is that we're going to see the best writers out there. And this is just an example, we're going to see them begin to turn into the best editors instead, right, and other similar situations like that. And I think the obvious fear with that is, if we're being honest, if you are a company or an organization of a certain size, you probably don't need quite as many editors, as you need writers, right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so I think, in my prediction, for smaller companies, that's that's going to be less true, because I think, for smaller companies, they're always going to need all the human capital they can get, especially in this labor market. But I think that the human downsizing, fear is really the heart of the worry. And I really believe that the first humans that will be impacted, it's weird to talk about robots versus humans, it just feels like we're not even living in the same planet anymore. But the first humans that are going to be impacted by any kind of downsizing that might potentially happen, are going to be the ones who refuse to embrace this new tech for the game changer that it is. I said this in my CMSWire article. But history is just never kind to those who fight progress, especially if it's technological, and content creators. I mean, we're certainly not the first field to fall in the name of innovation, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, you look at history, you've got factory workers and switchboard operators. And it's hard to find those fields anymore, that that are not just completely automated. So I think it's human nature, first of all, to look to improve task efficiency over time. So there's just always going to be tech that's eventually going to come along. And it's going to threaten to pull the rug out from under certain industries that maybe have historically relied on human labor. But the main problem, and this is just my personal beliefs and opinion disclaimer, but I think the main problem is that we as creatives always thought we were just going to be above this kind of threat, right, this artificial takeover, because we're the we're\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Who’s gonna write a headline for CMSWire if Dom Nicastro is gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eEmbracing AI in CX\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna:\u003c/strong\u003e But the thing is, and I think we're starting to see this, we aren't above that, you know, and, again, my own personal opinions, but the sooner we all start to get on board and figure out how to work within this new overall system. And when I say overall system, I mean, the marriage of the AI and the human element, instead of bemoaning it, the quicker we can kind of secure our own places in the future of CX and other creative endeavors. And I think that's kind of how you have to look at it, you know, good or bad.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and I think organizations are gonna have I'm sure they already do models for AI use, right, like bylaws, regulation policies and procedures. Because I wrote an article today, at the time of this podcast recording, early May, about the FTC issuing another warning, like they're constantly coming out with his blog post about, you can't be deceptive in your marketing, even though you use generative AI, just like you can't do it with search ads. You can't do it with generative AI, and you can't sneak in deceptive ads, you can't use generative AI to do a customer that's just trying to get out of their subscription, things like that. And also, they end with, Hey, you're gonna have to do more risk assessment internally, with your AI usage, you're gonna have to do more training. So this is going to create jobs, I think, you know, as much as it might take away jobs. You need people in there that are going to train people on ethical AI use as responsible AI use. Have you guys thought about that yet?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. And I've always said to my team, especially, I don't see this as really a threat. As much as an evolution. I think this is a natural evolution of the way our field is going to eventually go. Right? Because I think a lot of the concerns whether they be legal or ethical precedents will be set right? There will be at some point or another, laws that are set up, whether that's global or within an organization, or whatever that looks like there's going to be boundaries that become clear over time. The problem is we just have not had enough time to really make those clear yet. And that's not enough to stop this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna:\u003c/strong\u003e This is not going to stop just because there are some people out there that are saying, you know, well, we need to be careful with this and that and it's true, we do. But that's legal stuff that will work itself out. The thing is, I think organizations have to take a good hard look internally, and make sure that they're using it as ethically as they possibly can. And you're gonna have to kind of hold yourself to a higher standard right now until those overall precedents get set. And, again, I think it's a matter of time, I don't think it's not going to be a slowdown by any means of the development of this technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut right now, it's, we're just in that really weird gray area.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, that's true. Well, we've discussed such great topics, I mean, when we can bring our listeners into the office of CX practitioner, like literally inside of the organization, that's everything to us. So Brianna, can't thank you enough for that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is a very interesting topic to me. So I was very happy that this was what we decided to talk about today.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFostering Cross-Departmental Relationships for a Successful Transition\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, and let's bring it all home. You know, for the CX leader out there, the marketing leader out there who might be a little behind Waste Connections, the innovator of generative AI, the first to ever use it, the summer 2022. The one that's, you know, totally scoop ChatGPT. So let's give them that one big takeaway. What's the big message? Like, if I want to get started with my CX team? You know, what do I have to do here? Am I looking at hiring? Am I looking at new systems only? Where do I begin?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna: \u003c/strong\u003eAgain, I think I'm gonna probably give a little bit more philosophical of an answer than maybe what you're looking for. But honestly, I think if you're gonna go down this road, first of all, I've never met a CX practitioner, or leader who isn't gregarious, and just incredibly good at relationship building. And so I think, taking that outside of the boardroom, and taking that outside of, you know, pitching a new idea, or whatever, and really using that skill, to break down those silos within your organization, if you need to foster a relationship with the legal department, or whatever it looks like right now, I think just the more you make other departments internally feel respected and valued and heard, as you know, your entire organization moves down this road, because ultimately, whatever it is that you're creating with these bots, again, is going to be representative of your entire organization, right. So it's just really important to have that mix of voices at the table. So I would really recommend just getting outside of your own team and encouraging your team to do the same. And reaching across some of those tables to other departments and growing that professional bonds so that you are aligned when it comes to the direction you want to take as far as generative AI is concerned. Or you could just ask ChatGPT what you should do? How should we start ChatGPT with generative AI?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna:\u003c/strong\u003e Honestly, you probably get a better answer. No, just kidding.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDom: Well, this is awesome. I would love to say no, you know, not only I listeners know, now that they can follow you on CMSWire.com. You know, writing very frequent articles on CX marketing topics. Good stuff. They know that you exist on LinkedIn. But I think you do a little extra on LinkedIn, too. You have your own little personal brand that you want to share?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrianna: \u003c/strong\u003eSure, yeah, I have a newsletter.

That's all they see is your shirt.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e I can definitely relate to him.

I think we\u0026nbsp; should start with current first, let's get a little background on her. So if you wouldn't mind telling us a little bit about yourself, you know, what are your focus areas? And how did you get here?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. So first of all, thank you guys for all so much for having me. I'm Karina Crawford. I am based in town in the New Jersey area called West New York, which is basically like saying I'm based in New York.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd so most recently, I was the head of us marketing at Ford Motor Company, during a time that we were really driving marketing, transformation and kind of transforming the business as a whole to continue its evolution towards an electric future. But I've really built my entire career being a full stack, full funnel marketer that really prides on being also my full self, I really show up as me and that's the way that I lead organizations as well. Prior to being at Ford. I've also led different marketing strategy and media and creative roles across Verizon, JPMorgan Chase, Coca Cola, Miller Brewing Company, as well as some great agencies like Moxie.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e So when you talk about being full stack, do you come from like a technologist background?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna:\u003c/strong\u003e I don't actually, I actually grew up as a purebred marketer, my first roles were all at or for the Coca Cola company. And so I grew up as a true brand marketer, but very early on, I got excited about data and technology, I actually have a biomedical engineering degree. So in the way my brain functions, I'm highly analytical and data focused. But in the wake of the other part of my brain functions, I also really love creativity. And so I started on that side of the house, in licensed merchandise and event marketing, and then learned very quickly that digital was going to be the future. And inevitably, that also means data and technology. As the enablers of that have really been fuel to my career. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eI was just at a session with Tony Byrne of Real Story Group talking about the creation of a new role, like I think he called a marketing data ops person, someone who really needs to sit between the engineer the data scientists, and the marketers, the brand people the content drivers, like in all your roles, was there like a consistent place where you sat in the marketing role? Was it like more towards the data analytics I showed you earlier analytics person? Or was it brand And, and messaging and campaigns, or was it a little bit of both?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna:\u003c/strong\u003e I would answer the question a little differently than the way you posed it, I have always sat at the merge of creativity and data in roles that actually allow me to marry them together. So whether it's leading marketing as a whole, which inevitably, by default marries them together, but then also, it might be roles like I was, when I was at Coca-Cola, I was the director of media and interactive. And in that job, it is about audience targeting and data. At the same time as it is about the message, the storytelling and the creativity in the digital space, and how you bring those two things together, that's really where I thrive is when I'm bringing those things together, or I'm helping to enable a team to be able to bring those things together.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, you need those middle people, right like that brings IT and marketing together at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna: \u003c/strong\u003eThat's an actually a really important role that we were building when I was at Ford and that other organizations have identified because you've got this amazing talent bed of deep data and analytics, people who can probably solve any problem that you can imagine. And then you've also got those deep technology people. But then you have to be able to translate a business problem to them in a way that they can actually utilize it and drive the solutions. And so we in multiple ones, we've had a position that's kind of a marketing analytics or marketing ops type of role, where it's a person who is a marketer at their core and understands the marketing agenda. But they also have a level of technologist and a level of analysts in their heartbeat as well, that allows them to kind of be that bridge between the two.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/3-newish-ways-to-think-about-customer-loyalty/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"3 New(ish) Ways to Think About Customer Loyalty\"\u003e3 New(ish) Ways to Think About Customer Loyalty\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAvoiding Silos and Maximizing Martech Efficiency\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e We've talked a lot about the people. Let's just jump into the technology a little bit here. There's so much technology out there now. 11,000 martech solutions, right? And not even to mention all the AI things that are coming into play. Now? How do you approach leveraging these technologies to you know, get ahead of the curve and stay ahead of your competition?\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna: \u003c/strong\u003eOne of the things that I would say is, if you look at my career, most recently, I've been at a lot of large enterprises. So the challenge that I'm usually faced with is, how do you streamline your end, maximize or optimize your usage of the technology? Because there's always a plethora of stuff, because some group across the enterprise got something approved and installed, and now all of a sudden, you've got everything, right. And so the real opportunity is, is in taking a step back as a marketer, and saying, what are the business problems I'm trying to solve? How am I going to measure those things or enable those things, and then, which is the most efficient use of technology to enable that. A lot of instances, a technology solution is installed to solve a singular problem. And then you end up with five different unrelated technology solutions inside of your organization. And when you then are tasked with, Okay, what's the end end experience? And where are you seeing the drop off? Or where are you seeing the fall off? Or where do you have opportunity? You can't actually fully answer the question, because you put five point solutions in instead of thinking about the end to end experience you're delivering for your customer, and therefore how you're going to measure the experience from end to end. And so I think what I've really been pushing teams on is, make sure that you're looking at your technology decisions and your data decisions through the lens of what is the problem you're trying to solve? And how are you going to measure that problem?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e Do you see commonly that that is one of the ways that organizations get siloed? As far as data and analysis is that like you said, there's potentially five different solutions solving the same problem?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I've seen it in a couple of different ways. In some instances, the five different solutions solving a problem is because the organization was already siloed. And so as a result, since Bob wasn't talking to Jennifer, because their organization had separate remits, and they weren't in a mindset of working as an end to end integrated organization, then you end up with Jennifer had a problems, and Jennifer looked at the opportunity to solve it. Bob had a problem et cetera, et cetera. So in some instances, it's that in other instances, frankly, data is power. And so you find both technology solutions and data silos because of the fact that people want to maintain a level of power and influence inside of their enterprise. I pose though, that that is a short sighted way of looking at it. And it's also rooted in internal politics, not in best solution for your customers. So when I think about things in the way I push my teams, it's always pushing us to what is the problem we're trying to solve for the customer? And what is the best solution for that to enable that for the customer. And that continued to help drive a breaking down of barriers and silos both technologically and datawise.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e This discussion like brings up in My head martech audit martech audit, right? Like, have any of these iconic brands you worked for? done something like that? Where they said, Alright, let's get together, see what we have. So Bob and Jim, don't each buy a CRM, because we already have one? And who would lead that generally to in an organization?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. So I'm gonna answer that through my experiences, and then answer that through my point of view, which is not necessarily the same thing. Perfect. From an experience perspective, I would say yes, at every one of the companies that I've been at, there has been some look at an audit either, because we were earlier in the martec stage. And so it was less of an audit and more of a, what do we need, and let's do an enterprise view of what we're trying to create. And then in other instances, it's been, you know, like, for instance, in some of my more recent experiences, we've got everything under the sun available to us. But they're not connected, they're not interrelated to each other. And let's figure out what we want to do about it. The reality is, you need a steward, when you don't have a steward, who is helping to drive an enterprise cross divisional perspective, then you end up really struggling to have alignment on objectives, alignment on intent, and therefore alignment on solution. Now, I have seen instances where your IT slash chief technology organization is responsible for that, I've seen instances where your CMO organization responsible for it and where your digital organization or your EComm, organization etc, is responsible for it, I think it can be done in any of those ways. As long as whoever the core leader is helping to steward the decision making is thinking about things through the lens of the customer first, and the best solution to deliver for the customer. And then the most efficient and effective way for us to deliver that. And who's thinking about it with an enterprise mindset, not a siloed, individual, self self-serving mindset.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/building-a-next-level-customer-loyalty-program/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Building a Next-Level Customer Loyalty Program\"\u003eBuilding a Next-Level Customer Loyalty Program\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBalancing Immediate Needs and Future Aspirations\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich: \u003c/strong\u003eThe self serving mindset, it sounds bad, but I think a lot of us find ourselves in that situation where we're in a job, you get this problem that you have to solve. And it's like, I need to get this done ASAP. You go you buy a product, you put it on, you know, your your company credit card. And the next thing you know, six months later, you got like you said three people were doing different solutions ... \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Collecting dust \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e Or not being used even worse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna: \u003c/strong\u003eI've been in an organization where we had every solution under the sun and including, like Pega, and Adobe. And yet, we were using, we weren't even actually using the business rules engine for Pega, which was apparently the reason why we actually got Pega. But then as a result, you're every year going up against the CFO trying to justify why you're spending the investment for the solution. But in reality, your organization doesn't even know how to use the solution optimally. So I mean, it's a real thing. I lead my teams with a mindset of I call it OPP not to be mistaken with the song, outcomes, people and partnership. And so when we think about what solutions we're trying to create, we should be thinking about the people impact and the impact on the partnerships that we have, meaning our partners within the organization, you are not a winner if you solve your problem. And in doing so, it creates an equal and opposite problem in a partner's organization, you are a winner. If you find the best solution that meets the needs of both of you guys. Obviously, sometimes that isn't possible. But that means that you have to proactively align on what needs are not going to be met and why and ensure that you guys are approaching that from a partnership mindset. Enterprisewide thinking is how I believe people elevate inside of organizations siloed thinking is a in my opinion, a career killer because while it may get you really far and get you great performance scores right now, at the end of the day, people start to see that you make all of your choices and decisions for you and your best interest and not the best interest of the customer or the enterprise.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e But it is true in these meetings between marketing and technologists that you can in fact start the meeting with Naughty By Nature's theme song OPP correct. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYou can start the meeting with that song if you want.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna: \u003c/strong\u003eYou can. Now here's what I will tell you that I have learned over the years because that has been the OPP has been my mantra for many many years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;And that is outcome people in partnership.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna: \u003c/strong\u003eCorrect.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eHow can you not blast that in your, in your car? If you hear that? On the radio, I've said FM radio to the kids and I listen to FM radio. So I feel like I may need to come up with like a new mantra that I use when I'm when I'm setting up my organizations because I feel like I'm losing the cache. Yeah, that I want to add contemporary artists you might have to throw like, The Weekend. Yeah. But being with these iconic brands character, and again, by the way, beautiful Austin, Texas here, Rich this is awesome, we're in person doing this podcast, this is amazing. CMSWire CONNECT three days and Friday is the last day, which will enter this podcast, but kind of in those iconic brands, how did you go about fostering that culture of creativity, collaboration, to eventually drive innovation and growth? Because innovation is such a nice word makes you feel all warm and fuzzy. But sometimes it's like, I have a great idea. Why doesn't it go anywhere? You know, how does it die in like a Slack chain? That's where great ideas go to die, right? Slack chains?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e Or email? Yeah, exactly. No one does anything about it. So what were some of your core concepts to really approach that true collaboration, creativity and innovation?\u003c/p\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eKarna: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, let me first say that I have had instances where I've been more successful in instances where I've been less successful. And so no one is perfect at it, especially when you're in these kind of legacy, wonderful heritage enterprises that are rooted in risk elimination. But there are a couple of things that I believe in and that I then instill in my organizations. One is be courageous. Make sure that \"no\" is a challenge, as opposed to \"no\" being a barrier or a dream killer.\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e We should take that into account, we hear no, here and there, don't we, Rich?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e That's usually a dream killer, Dom.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna: \u003c/strong\u003eAnother really important aspect of creating a culture that will be supportive of innovation is being choosy. And when I say be choosy, I'm meaning prioritization. A lot of times, the reason why dreams die is because you've got 1000 dreams, and no focus and no prioritization. So that's a, that's a second key one for me. And then the last one is Be Now, and when I talk about being now I'm talking about making sure that not every innovation, and every new approach, or new idea is so far out that it requires an effort to be able to achieve it, you need to make sure that your innovation ideas and your innovation roadmap is rooted in now. And then, so that you can make some small wins, you can drive some progress, you can build and maintain momentum, versus really great ideas that look extremely cumbersome, that are inside of 1,000 other ideas and are sitting out there because they're going to never go anywhere, because they're going to take you forever to do and too many people and they're not being prioritized.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know, it's a great point, because you are good at that I have a lot of great ideas that I share with my boss, this guy sitting across the room from me. And he'll say, great, but what about six months from now. And that's exactly what you were talking about. I'll give you an example. The AI column that Jenn Torres does. So it's called \"All in on AI. \"We every week, we do a bunch of nuggets on what's going on in the world of AI because I was so excited. Everyone's so excited about AI now with ChatGPT coming out in November. And I said let's do a column. And Rich says, Okay, what happens when the a buzz dies down? Right? You know, do we just stop doing the column and I said like, it's not going to die down, Rich, not gonna die down. But he made a great point. But AI hasn't died down and we're going to still run with it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;You make a good point, because I also kind of inherent in all of that is having a strategic lens. So I have, you know, my team back at Ford, fantastic group of people. What I ensured was that we had a really clear view of strategically what we needed to accomplish, so that the innovation direction and the thing, the ideas that we were stewarding sat inside of that, so in our instance, it might have been things like we need to drive growth with women, Hispanic and African American. One of the mechanisms for us to do that is to be a digital first and social first organization that tells stories that are relevant to those audiences. So then when my team is thinking about innovation and great ideas, etc. They're thinking about it through the lens of how will we enable doing that one innovative approach that my team took was to crowdsource the name of a new Mustang vehicle, something that they had never done. Obviously, not necessarily the first time. any name for something has spent crowdsourced. But for our company, it was a groundbreaking approach that was rooted in being customer centric and being relevant to a specific audience, we therefore went to that audience to come up with the name, which then led us to a new approach to how we can really make sure that we're connecting with those audiences are \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Talking about voice of the customer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich: \u003c/strong\u003eI can't remember the details. But there was a story a year or two ago, where I think it was the British government put out a contest where they wanted somebody that named the next naval ship. So they put it out and they got back was not a name that they wound up using, because that's where there is a problem.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;The world have fun, clear their light of day for various reasons. And then even of the top of the top performers, you still have to go through due diligence with legal and trademark and all those things. But at its core, what's really important is how you listened to the customer in a social first, where they are way to help create something that is designed by and for them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, you just talked briefly about targeting different demographics and different people. And I think that brings up a big question. I mean, you've worked for some of the most iconic brands in the US. And, you know, how does an organization like for example, JP Morgan, or Ford Motor Company? What is their approach to customer loyalty? And brand consistency? Like, how how's that baked into your thought process?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna: \u003c/strong\u003ethere are a couple of things I would say. One is absolutely the brand. And the product can be a driver of loyalty and passion. And that's where brands like Bronco brands like Mustang play really well. But there is a broader lens of loyalty than just that. One of the things that Ford was in the process of doing is helping to create a relationship with customers that goes beyond the purchase itself, creating services, creating experiences and creating content that would create a relevant experience for them in between vehicle purchases, so that they have a reason to care and love the brand, even when it's not a passion brand, right? So how do I get people to love and care for an escape, or being a Ford owner, just as much as you know, someone that might have been a passionate fan or fanatic have a Mustang or a Bronco?\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Who came up with a Ford Freestar name, because I had that that sucker drove me six hours back and forth on Christmas, I'm being serious like this. There's so much emotional connections to vehicles. everyone goes, remember that car!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna:\u003c/strong\u003e Because it's connected to experience in your life, and that and that's what's really important. So when you think about what vehicles can do today, the technology that's enabled in them the data and the digital connectivity, it allows your vehicle to be a part of experiences in all new way, that then creates new memories, new emotional connections and new opportunities for people to fall in love with the brand and stay in love with the brand. And I you know, there there was a point where you guys were asking me a little bit about how do you maintain brand consistency, while driving innovation, I don't see those as at odds to each other. Because in my opinion, your innovation has to be rooted in your brand and your brand strategy. If you do innovation for innovation sake, and it's not aligned to where the brand and the business needs to go, then that's where inconsistency comes from. That's also where waste comes from. So unless you're a company that is looking for a new spark and a new approach or a new direction, typically your goal is for your innovation to be enabling the brand delivering on the brand and helping to take that brand to mean more to your customer.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. I'd love to hear about some of the initiatives that you're the most proud of that you've worked with in the organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKarna: \u003c/strong\u003eA couple of things that I will say is when I was at Ford, one of the initiatives that I was the most proud of was the work that we did when we were launching the Maverick. The Maverick was our first compact size pickup vehicle that was designed specifically to engage a multicultural audience and women for the people who didn't know they needed pickup truck. And we took a strategic approach both to the way the product was designed and to the go to market strategy to make it laser focused on being relevant to that multicultural and female audience. A digital first approach our first ever TikTok endeavor. And we utilized data to then also enable how we were reaching and finding those customers out in the marketplace. We also utilized great African American talent as a part of the launch with Gabrielle Union and really told the story of a pickup in a very non-traditional truck way. That was for our business in our brand, one of the most of the innovative approaches to a go to market strategy. And it led to the vehicle being sold out.

A part of it is from a productivity perspective, there are simple basic things that we generate, as marketers, that we spend unnecessary time doing that we could just get done faster and cheaper. There's a lot of opportunity there. I also think that there's opportunity where this can actually become a tool inside of a lot of our operational processes that will accelerate and speed up some of the things that we do operationally, I'm still at the learning stage here, and the testing and trying stage, but it's something that I really want to go deep on.

A prime example of successful loyalty-building is Starbucks, which has consistently led the pack by attentively addressing customer concerns, investing heavily in rewards programs and making data-driven decisions based on the wealth of information these programs generate. By continually measuring customer loyalty and tailoring offerings and rewards to customer preferences, Starbucks has fostered increased loyalty, resulting in long-term business success.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this discussion, Michelle Morris, a customer experience and business transformation leader at\u0026nbsp;\u003ca title=\"Verizon Connect\" href=\"https://www.verizonconnect.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eVerizon Connect\u003c/a\u003e, examines the critical role of understanding and measuring customer loyalty in today's dynamic business environment.

Thank you so much for your time. Today, we're gonna focus, like we said on customer loyalty. I got a statistic. Now, I can't tell you who I got this from because it came from ChatGPT. So it could have come from my mother. It could have come from Socrates. I don't know. But it says acquiring a new customer can be anywhere from five to 25 times more expensive than retaining an existing customer. Right off the bat. Is that something that resonates with you in terms of that number in that great disparity?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eAnd yeah, who knows about the five to 10?

So the big generic question is, you know, as a CX practitioner, what role does customer loyalty ultimately play for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eCustomer Loyalty really defines a lot of our roles as CX practitioners, everything's about that. It's about customer loyalty. So our role is really, to help define it for our business to understand what the drivers are of that loyalty, very specific to each of our businesses. And then to help the business to actually do something about where improvement is needed. Loyalty can come in all kinds of ways, it can be simply in a great customer support experience. And therefore you want to continue to come back, it can come in the form of a product that never has a problem, it could come in the form of an amazing interaction if you're in a service, business and amazing interaction with someone you do business with on a regular basis. So understanding exactly what those experiences are that drive loyalty the most is the key to what we do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and, you know, we always like to level so even on articles and CMSWire.com, we have that little one step back paragraph that says, What is this that we're talking about? And we do that a lot, and they can be good to engage the listeners here to tell them like, what exactly is the definition that a CX practitioner would have of customer loyalty? Because I think some people might hear that, so you know, I get it, I get it, you just want customers to keep paying you every now and again. But is there like a raw definition or some definition that stands out? In your head, Michelle?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Yeah, when I think of\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/05/01/how-to-use-a-mobile-app-to-improve-customer-loyalty/?sh=44792b5019f6\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"loyalty\"\u003eloyalty\u003c/a\u003e, in general, it is a choice to not want to have a relationship with anyone else in that space. So I you know, even outside of the business, relationships, any kind of loyalty to a friend, etc, you know, essentially means I'm sticking with that person. And for businesses, you know, the loyalty I consider is you're at the top level of loyalty. When you decide, you would never want to go and work with another business doesn't matter. They are doing an amazing job and they make you as the consumer, so happy that you don't want to leave. And you know, we can measure that in all kinds of different ways. Obviously, there's some basic satisfaction, types of questions that can be answered or you know, the likelihood to recommend question, but however you measure it within your company. It is really just a matter of understanding that a customer is not going to leave\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMeasuring Loyalty\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Yeah, speaking of measurement, you know, how would you, as a CX practitioner typically measure this yourself? What are some of those key metrics for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eI definitely measure with Net Promoter Score as using the likelihood to recommend question. But I also have used indexes where there is a group of questions that are answered that help understand various angles of loyalty, whether it's effort or ease of doing business, and the willingness to recommend. So I think that there's a level of even just liking to do business with a company, I think that comes into play as well. So I will say that I'm agnostic in how I choose my loyalty metric, really, I think it just you got to pick one, and then you stay with it, and you use it to guide your business moving forward. It's really not at the end about that end metric. It's more about those things that drive that loyalty that matters. So I try not to get as hung up on the end metric, and focus more on the things underneath it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;How do you feel when those debates are happening on LinkedIn every all the CX practitioners get so amped up about NPS versus CSAT versus, and it sounds like to me in your role, it's like that you don't stress out about the actual metric, you’re stressed out about keeping customers loyal, through metrics kinda. Is that am I getting that, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Yeah, absolutely. Right. So any one of those top level metrics that I just mentioned, might be a great way of measuring it as a lagging indicator, but it's really what are those things underneath it, that you can change in your business, to ultimately change that lagging indicator. So using the leading indicator, if you, if you have an issue with product quality, then get to the bottom of what the product quality is find a way to test your product into a way that's going to be satisfactory for your client, or your customer, and use that as the measure to fix your product quality. And then it will show up as an end result in the surveys around product quality, and around loyalty. So it's kind of more of like what's underneath that loyalty that matters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/3-newish-ways-to-think-about-customer-loyalty/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"3 New(ish) Ways to Think About Customer Loyalty\"\u003e3 New(ish) Ways to Think About Customer Loyalty\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePresenting Customer Loyalty\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and when you're presenting, you know, findings on customer loyalty, and everything is there like that one score, at the end of the day, like, hey, this defines our customer loyalty, this is how it's affecting my world, my business, there's not that one shining number, if you will, like for me, it's like engagement on my article like that's cut and dry. You know, how many people are in there engaging? Is it like that customer loyalty? Or does it go a lot deeper than that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Well, I would never just show only one measure. It's oftentimes what gets talked about in my business. But as a practitioner, I feel like I would be not doing my job well if that was all I did. So it's one number that comes along with a whole lot of other measures that go across the entire journey, as well, as you know, actual comments and feedback and things that customers say, I mean, we all know, emotion drives us to make decisions better, or do our jobs differently. So bringing in that customer's voice, what their sentiment is to the conversation. Absolutely is one of the things that you want to present along with the end numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, getting in front of a customer and actually having an actual conversation with the customer. A lot of practitioners have told us it's just so incredibly valuable. Does that exist? Like does the opportunity like that exist? I know, it's so hard, like, because I can't sit here and say, I talk to CMSWire readers every day. Man, would I like to? Yes. Is that a challenge, getting actually in front of customers and hearing those anecdotes, hearing those frustrations outside of the data collection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eYes and no. If your company has a customer support center, you can listen to customer calls all day long and hear it all. But in other parts of the business where it may be like in businesses where you have more of a B2B relationship, and there's a lot of different stakeholders at play, it can be difficult to get all of the voices of the various stakeholders. And so you have to be very intentional at some level of your business about who is talking to those stakeholders and being able to bring that voice back into the business. If for instance, you're in a service type of an industry, you've got folks that are probably looking at the entire service experience. And they're thinking about what actually happens during that experience. So they're out talking to customers at that point. Having just a simple video camera with you or your cell phone is going to capture that and can be brought back and watched. And we do that and we have in various other places that I've worked at, we have that as well. And those are the meaningful parts of, you know, being able to really listen to the customer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/customer-loyalty-programs-delivering-the-most-bang-for-the-buck/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Customer Loyalty Programs: Delivering the Most Bang for the Buck\"\u003eCustomer Loyalty Programs: Delivering the Most Bang for the Buck\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTop Challenges in Customer Loyalty\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eYeah. What are some of those top of mind challenges that you come across frequently with customer loyalty? I mean, for me, you know, my biggest challenge is trying to be unique, trying to convince people to read our stuff versus someone else's on the same topic, and then trying to write topics that no one else has. So it's a daily struggle to stand out from this crowded world of the web, where our business model lives and breathes. What would be some of the top challenges for you in terms of customer loyalty?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;It's a great question. I don't think it's a simple answer, right? Your business is certainly different than the business I'm currently in. But ground rules, you have to do the basics, right? You have to make sure everything's operational and working. And those basic needs are met. But beyond that, you know, having a really good vision. And a really good strategy about how you want to be in the market is the key, aligning your organization, then around that vision of what a great customer experience looks like, and what is your unique selling point, that's the key. So being true to who you are, as a brand, and a company will really show up in the market. If you're true to yourself. I think, obviously, there's in the business that you're in, where it is maybe a little bit more crowded market space, you have to find ways to bring it to the attention of new customers, but also for those continual listeners, right? What are you bringing new? What are you bringing to them that they want to continue to come back and listen to? So really understanding what their needs and wants are is always important?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Michelle, how do you differentiate between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty? Because those seem like they go hand in hand, right? You would think a satisfied customer equals a loyal customer. But I'm guessing that might not always be the case. What do you think?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;They definitely are similar, right. And a loyal customer is one who is satisfied. But loyalty takes usually a little bit more than just satisfaction, it takes that little bit of something special or extra. When I think about loyalty versus satisfaction, the first thing that comes to my mind is theme parks. And there's that beautiful place in Florida that has multiple different kinds of theme parks, there's definitely a loyalty that comes for many customers with going to one specific park, the other one may be of interest, and you may be satisfied with it. But there's just something extra about that one amusement park that draws you there. So what is it? What is that exactly? That is what our role is, is to find out what that is? Play on it or create it? If that's the case. So loyalty is somewhat like, what do they say, trust, first thing to go. And the last thing that comes back right now, and I think, you know, maintaining a loyalty for a given brand requires the brand to constantly always be investing in that trustworthiness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCustomer Loyalty Evolution\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Yeah. And over the years, you've been a practitioner in CX, you know, for a good period of time, if you were to look back at, say, the first half of your career versus now, are there any major differences, you know, in customer loyalty approaches? Because, again, going back to my example, if I look back at journalism, the first half of my career, it was a lot of the same principles, right. But once the story was out in the print newspaper where I started, you were done. You didn't have to promote it. You just hoped and guessed that people read the thing? And how did you know maybe you got a phone call or two we always used to say. So if one person calls, that means 10 people feel the same way. I don't know why we have that metric. And we never tested it. We never proved it. We just said it. So we said it. It was true. But the point is, you know, looking back at your first half of your career with customer loyalty versus now with digital transformation with AI with all these technologies coming is there a huge difference in the customer loyalty game or not? Or do many of the same principles still apply now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;My background is in engineering. So really the first half of my career you know, I did traditional product development engineering. And it's what got me into customer experience in the first place, because I had put so much effort into designing products. And I always wondered, well, do they like, does the customer really even like this thing? I mean, we put a lot of blood sweat and tears into it, right? Do they like it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd it was in all of the questioning of my leadership that I got to start into this role of figuring out what customer experience is for the company I worked for. And back then, which was, you know, 15 years ago, we were doing surveys by phone, we were paying a lot of money, probably closer to $10 per call, just to get and talk to someone on the phone and get their feedback. So I mean, talk about a difference, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe were moving into online or email based surveys we were looking at, you know, from that point, what are the the way you ask the question, phrasing and such looking even at just the Likert scale, whether we were using the right scales or not. And then of course, Net Promoter Score came around from Fred and, you know, we were able to, really, as an industry kind of think about, well, are we measuring the right things?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;So, from the past to now? I mean, I would say, what we know, today is a lot more about customer loyalty, and about the space. Has it really changed? I'm not sure. I think we just know a lot more about it. Right? I think things that drove loyalty 20 years ago are probably some of the exact same things that drive loyalty today.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy is that? Well, people are people, and people are the ones that are making these decisions. And so they are designed to base all of our logic on what's in front of us and the experiences we've had in the past. So I don't know that that's really shifted or changed much. I do think, though, that what we understand about it has, and that makes it such a rewarding profession to be a customer experience practitioner because we get to dig in and learn more about it every single day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and then your role. You know, obviously, there's other departments and everything like that a person like you has to work with. Does a CX leader like you need to really be good at cross department collaboration, when it comes to customer loyalty. Is there a certain department that needs to be constantly involved in this? Is there a lot of crossover with customer loyalty programs with, say, like marketing, sales, that kind of thing? Do you find yourself as a CX leader having to cross collab in that sense, a lot?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eOh, yeah, every day. That's really what our role is, is we are cross functional leaders that have to work things out amongst the entire organization. So yeah, everywhere, from sales, to marketing, to customer support, to operations, to manufacturing, product development, those all come into play for everything that we do. And, and that's sometimes the biggest trick of what we're doing as practitioners with a lot of change we’re change managers, we make the business, try to think about things differently and design things better for the customer. So with that comes having to have the ability to work across the entire organization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eUnlocking Customer Loyalty With Data\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we just had a article recently, on CMSWire about combo sales and marketing working together. And I thought that issue was done. Apparently, we still have to figure that one out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;I don't think it'll ever be done.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Who wants the credit for this marketing attribution numbers, and people like to fight over the credit, end of the day, it's what the customer feels, and churn and loyalty, the things you care about a lot as a customer experience practitioner, so hey, we're heading to the end here. And I just wanted to kind of put a big, big ribbon bow on this whole conversation, we covered so much good ground, so much for practitioners to feed on and think about, if there were the one big takeaway with customer loyalty right now, where you're currently focusing as a CX practitioner, one huge takeaway for our audience, would there be something from this conversation you really like them to say, You know what, I experienced this? Think about it, you might want to try it at your org.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Yeah, narrowing that down to one thing would be difficult. But the thing that's on my mind these days, is\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/challenges-or-opportunities-maximizing-customer-data-to-thrive-in-2023/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"data\"\u003edata\u003c/a\u003e. It's all about data. And how you organize your data, look at it across different channels of data that come in and try and make sense of it. That's the key.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe're all sitting on mounds of gold, that tell us just anything we would want to know. So sorting it out to, you know, make heads or tails and drive a strategic decision for the business. That's the trick, right? And so how do you get your head in your organization to organize the data in a way that you can make some intelligence out of it, create those insights, and then use those to drive the business differently?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRarely do we have to create new sources or forms to gather that data, it's probably just sitting there. And I think that one way that we've been focusing on it, is to really think not only about those customers perceptions, and what they think, but then tying that together with all of the things that drive those perceptions. And traditionally, those would be things within the leading indicators, like I was mentioning earlier, that would be around your operational data, that will give you some idea, that's the key, how do you get that data and oftentimes, in the business, you know, those significant points don't necessarily exist, and you have to go create a new\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/20-customer-experience-metrics-critical-for-your-business/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"metric\"\u003emetric\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, that is the trick, and very rewarding when you find it. So that would be kind of the one major thing that I would get at with driving loyalty is finding those right metrics that matter. And then changing them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So a follow up question to that would be, you know, is it basically at the time now, where CX people, leaders like yourself getting into young CX folks that want to get into a role like yours? Do they need some kind of data analytics chops? Now, obviously, they need to be able to analyze data, do they actually need to be like, certified these days or take courses in college with\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/customer-data-analytics-top-priorities-for-customer-service-leaders/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"data analysis\"\u003edata analysis\u003c/a\u003e?

And, you know, one course in college that I think is probably the course that I've used the most in my entire career is statistics because data can be very easily mishandled. And yet, we're making really big decisions on data.

And it's all about the inner workings of the chief marketing officer, which of course, is a key persona that we cover on CMSWire pretty heavily. The report that you're doing not only delves into the CMO psyche, but also complements the ongoing research we do in digital experience and customer data management. There's a lot of really cool information in here. What was the motivation behind this report’s inception?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah:\u003c/strong\u003e You mentioned it right off, you know, we do a lot of research into customer experience. And at CMSWire, we want to have the deepest understanding possible of what's happening out there in customer experience. CMO is a critical role, one of I would say two critical roles for crafting the customer journey, especially the digital customer experience. And it's also a role that's been in really rapid evolution, especially since the pandemic. So we decided last year to do a deep dive into the role of the CMO and to take a really hard look at how it's changing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of last year, we sent out a survey, we had 709 people who lead the marketing function, in whole or part, who participated in the study, we will be repeating the study annually. And we're also going to be branching out to study some of the other roles that are really critical for the customer experience.

So we'll include a link in the landing page as well for that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut let's forget all that, let's get into the findings because marketing leaders listening to this want to see if they can relate to what we found in our research here. So first one, Sarah, I'm going to kick to you to walk through is the top skills for a CMO. And this one's fascinating. I've been a reporter in the space for 10 years. And these skills keep changing every single year. The big one I've seen is the datasets having the data chops to analyze slice-and-dice data. That's a big one. But it wasn't the big one for us in this report.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah:\u003c/strong\u003e No. And in fact, it was our first big surprise. So just like you we expected to hear that CMOs needed to have a lot of data analytic skills or that there were a lot of technical competencies that were super important for them. But that actually wasn't what they said. What they said was that the top skill for being a marketing leader is creative thinking. And it wasn't just, you know, oh, this is like slightly more important. It was the top skill for marketing leaders by a gap of 22 percentage points. So that's just about as significant as it gets in statistics.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were some other answers, strategic management, leadership skills and executive leadership. But more than anything else, people said that being a creative problem solver, that creative thinking was absolutely critical to the role of the CMO. And that's really fascinating.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I felt like it gave us some insight into how do CMOs think of themselves when they think about you know, how they perform and what the performance of their role is. What's super important to them is how do I solve this problem creatively, we tend to think about all of the order taking part of the CMO role. But for them, it's how do I solve this problem? Pretty fascinating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/cx-decoded-podcast-inside-the-cmswire-state-of-digital-customer-experience-report/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\u0026amp;nbsp;CX Decoded Podcast: Inside the CMSWire State of Digital Customer Experience Report\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;CX Decoded Podcast: Inside the CMSWire State of Digital Customer Experience Report\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Evolving Role of the CMO\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e We're gonna get into a little bit of the CMO evolution but this role has just evolved so much and so with it has the skills that these people need to be successful in this role. I mean creativity and innovation, they may top the list. But you've got to be a strategic thinker, you got to stay current on industry knowledge. You guys already talked about analytics and data driven decision-making, leadership and team skills, and there's more, but those are like the big buckets. And then you just have to be adaptable and flexible to whatever's going on in the marketplace. And we've seen over these last several years that there has been a lot going on in this marketplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah:\u003c/strong\u003e Right. And that agility is really key, I think that's what's kind of underneath this focus on creativity for them is that I take all of the circumstances under which we're trying to get our marketing message out, the market conditions, everything else, what we actually have available to us in terms of technology, what I have available to me in terms of resources, and how can I use all of that and do something, achieve my objectives?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what they're saying is, I have to get really creative about that. But you know, you've mentioned like, you know, the technical skills and the data skills, and I don't want to kind of undercut that, because we certainly have a lot of data that shows that those are important. But first and foremost, you know, they really see themselves as creative thinkers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I'm gonna pick the brains of some of these CMOs to show me what they're doing creatively, because I've talked to so many of them over the years that it's there's just so overwhelmed with performance, net revenue, stuff like that, those numbers that CFOs haunt them about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I'm curious to know, Sarah, was there any comments or anything in that survey question in open comments? Was there anything related to that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah:\u003c/strong\u003e About the agility? For sure, thinking that I've got to keep up, I've got to stay on top of things, I have to use what I've got, there were a lot of things like that in the comments. And you know, getting people on board. And there was even a lot of “it depends,” and “it depends” is kind of the creative answer. It's, I'm looking at my context, I'm trying to figure out how to address what I'm trying to achieve with what I've got. And I think it's that kind of mindset that we see. And we did see it in a lot of the comments, some of which are in the report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e Sarah, you mentioned that the way that CMOs see themselves as creative thinkers, I guess is what we're saying. Can you talk a little bit about how the organization sees them? How the people that they work with see them versus how they see themselves?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah: \u003c/strong\u003eRight. So my answer here is going to be a little anecdotal. But I'm sure that it'll jibe with what you hear as well, which is, what we hear is that a lot of other departments look at marketing and see it as transactional, right. And understandably, they're looking for what they want to get out of the marketing function they're looking for, I need leads, and I need customers, and we need customers to come back again, you know, they're looking for the results of what marketing gets them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it, it leads them to think of marketing as a very transactional thing, I think. What I found really fascinating here is there's this kind of resistance in CMOs to looking at their role that way. They don't see themselves as transactional; they do see themselves as creative.

That's amazing that it was 60, it should be 100, probably, but all that creativity, that you have to have some backing to it, and it actually has to work. Next finding was about how the role of the marketing leader is changing. So what else did you find here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah:\u003c/strong\u003e So yeah, and I'll definitely get to that. So the super interesting thing here, we asked them, How is your role changing? And how has it been changing. And what they say is that they are now required to have more cross functional partnership with the sales team. That's not a big surprise.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey're also feeling more pressure to improve the customer experience, their role is now more likely to involve robust data strategies. So that's a big one. And they've also been tasked with digital transformation of the marketing function.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we've been seeing for years now in the \"\u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www-cmswire.simplermedia.com/cw-cp-smg-dcx-report-cx.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"State of the Digital Customer Experience\"\u003eState of the Digital Customer Experience\u003c/a\u003e\" survey, that there's a lot of growth in marketing tools and platforms and the kind of the technology that surrounds customer experience and marketing is just booming. So that's also not a big surprise. But you know, that's a lot of change to be kind of heaping onto a single role. That's a lot going on for marketers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e When we say that 59% of leadership expect to see measurable results. Did anybody share in the comments or open comments about what those intangible things are, that leaders don't expect hard results for? Because that's like Dom said, it seems like that number should be higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah:\u003c/strong\u003e And we expected that number to be higher. We were actually a little shocked that it wasn't very close to 100%. One of the kind of big open questions, you know, because what we hear a lot anecdotally is that marketers have to justify every single spend that they have has to have an ROI or business impact attached to it. Like that's what we hear. And we wanted to know how true that was. So we did ask them, What are the expectations of your leadership, we expected that to be a very, very high number. And we were a little shocked that it was only 59%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what 41% said was that their leadership understands that some things can't really be measured, you know that there are some things that you're not going to be able to draw a direct line from what we do as marketers to exactly what the impact is, for the organization is just a little too messy in there. And a lot of that has to do with the business context, which can be variable from organization to organization. It may also have to do with exactly what does the organization do and what metrics are available, you know, because if they're not available through business intelligence, if you're not collecting business intelligence metrics, or if you don't have all of that collected together in a place where you can match it up with your marketing spend, then it's really hard to draw that line at all.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so we did see some of that in the comments people talking about, well, we can't really get the data integrated, or we're really not able to measure this. Something that's a little bit more squishy, something that's a little bit more difficult to measure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/cmo-circle-christopher-p-willis-on-community-sales-marketing-collaboration/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CMO Circle: Christopher P.

We had Tom Wentworth, chief marketing officer of \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://rapidminer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"RapidMiner\"\u003eRapidMiner\u003c/a\u003e on a podcast. And he talked about his podcast in his company. And he hires journalists to do blogs, to do news articles, they consider themselves a news source now, are those news articles and those podcasts directly relating to sales for his company? No, not always. And guess what, he doesn't care. He just wants to be out there, be considered a source, get ranked high in Google Search, and almost be like a news outlet. So I totally can back that, Sarah, that contention that not all CMOs, are showing ROI for every single move they make.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah: \u003c/strong\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eSo maybe that 59% number actually makes more sense now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. And if you think about what the value of a brand is, that's a little squishy itself, it obviously does have a value to build your brand to raise awareness, you know, but it's not necessarily true that every single thing you do to raise awareness is something that leads to a change in the bottom line, that it's all part of a concerted effort that leads to an impact. But each particular thing that you do doesn't necessarily show an outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich: \u003c/strong\u003eWe are almost ready to move on. But I do think it bears mentioning a couple of things here. One is one is typically CMOs have the shortest tenures of all execs that's somewhere between like two and a half and four years, typically. And we're talking about the roles that the CMO has gone through in time. And I would say that this is probably one of the most tumultuous roles that I can think of. I mean, it didn't seem that long ago, where CMOs were just primarily focused on traditional marketing methods, and, and then 2019, 2018, marketing automation, which is everybody's moving to RPA, and all these other things, and then 2020 had the pandemic.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo next two years, everybody spent adjusting to that. And then we went back to the workplace, and there are still people who are working remotely. I mean, there's just so much that this role has had to deal with and change. I mean, I can't think of another role that has had this much tumult in it over the last several years. Can you guys?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah:\u003c/strong\u003e I actually can't either. We noticed right away in 2020, when we did the \"State of the Digital Customer Experience\" survey, that marketers were having a tough time. It was not a very smooth transition for them. A lot of them were caught sort of flat-footed. Their organizations hadn't made the investments in digital customer experience platforms, say on the digital workplace side, there had been a lot of investment, it was a lot easier of a transition to bring people into remote working.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for digital customer experience, it was a really rough ride. And it didn't necessarily get better. Because as you mentioned, customer preferences changed. A lot of platforms were adopted, suddenly, there was a lot of sort of technical skills and platforms to learn and a lot of complete change in the customer journey for everyone.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agree that this role has been through quite a lot. I wouldn't be surprised if you know, I haven't looked into it. But I would not be surprised at all to hear that this role was experiencing much higher attrition than others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCMOs Grapple with Technology Explosion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, marketing went through a lot in that pandemic with layoffs and stuff. And there was a lot of reporting on marketing jobs loss. So who was at the forefront of that? Our friends that we did the report on? So it’s absolutely been a tumultuous role.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's move on to finding number three, maybe get to one more, maybe two depending on how much we last here because remember, we don't want to get with the whole report. We want people to download this thing. Absolutely. So let's move on. So the report it talks about just how true is it the marketing leaders need to increase their technical competency. So there it is, there this something that we've been talking about throughout this whole podcast. So, Sarah, what did CMSWire’s research team find in this one,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat we found was that three-out-of-four marketing leaders say that they've had to increase their technical competencies, either significantly, or moderately in the past three years. So that's pretty ubiquitous, that's almost everybody. And those who haven't could be much smaller organizations or already had those skills to begin with, and didn't necessarily have to increase their skills. So it's been a just a huge wave of increased skills on the technical side, for marketing leaders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich: \u003c/strong\u003eWere there any insights into the particular skills as the things we've already talked about? Right, like data analytics and insights and the pace of marketing technology and having to keep up with that stuff? Is that the driving force behind that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we are talking about the need to increase skills with technology and platforms specifically. So one of the things that's kind of happened here is that this explosion of CX technologies, you might think like, well, you know, everyone goes through a wave of learning it, and then we're all upskilled. Right, and now we're ready to deal with this again.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what we actually see in the \"State of the Digital Customer Experience\" survey is that not only has there been a giant wave of adoption in CX technologies, there's a giant wave of adoption planned. We've got about one-in-three organizations are looking to adopt 15 separate tools in the next couple of years. So this investment in technology is leading to more investment in technology, the success that organizations have seen through using CX technology has led them to invest more in CX technology.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo this kind of a wave of adoption of technology, it's not finished, it's not over as much change, as marketing leaders have seen with technology, there's more change on the horizon. That is coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich: \u003c/strong\u003eDom, you and I have talked in the past about app overload. And there's just so many different apps and platforms that you and I have to go into every day, I can't imagine, I know, the modern marketer has even more, adding 15 more tools on top of the 50 you’re already doing sounds like quite a challenging role for the CMO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e The ones I talked to, you know, we do persona research, the chief marketing officers I talked to, they seem to do a good job of focusing on those two to three tools that they really need to do their jobs, the least the ones I talked to. So anecdotally, and those are the tools that are showing revenue, marketing, attribution, that kind of thing, the customer data platforms, those kinds of tools. So I think they're getting better at management. And there's a whole role for that, right. It's like the martech strategic adviser, right, or the digital operations leader, which is another role that we pursue as a persona here at CMSWire.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo if the CMO isn't the de facto digital operations leader, they need to certainly work closely with that person, in terms of just making sense of all the martech tools and not being buried in all these tools they don't need to be in. I wanted to wrap things up, because again, Sarah, you're too good, we can't give away too much, because we gotta let people download this thing. So let's finish up. You already mentioned some surprises. Were there any other surprises top of mind that we didn't get to like maybe one surprise that caught you and your team's attention? Outside of the other surprises we kind of already discussed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow Worried Are Marketers About Changing Privacy Regulations?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah: \u003c/strong\u003eThere was one more really big surprise. So we asked marketing leaders, just how worried are they about changing privacy regulations? And how is this going to change their job, you know, are they really — are they stressing out about that, and we fully expected to have a majority of marketing leaders tell us that they were really worried that this was going to impact their role, and it was going to make customer experience more difficult. And you know, it's going to make marketing, achieving their goals more difficult. And that's not what they said at all.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarketers are really not that worried about changing privacy regulations and the impact of that on their job. And this took us hugely by surprise, it took us a while to kind of sort through it and see, you know, what's going on? Why is that? And it appears to be that this is actually old news to marketers. They've had a long time to adjust to the idea that there were more regulations coming that privacy was a huge concern, and they are not panicking anymore. So more than half of the marketing leaders in the study said that they're only slightly or not at all concerned about changing regulations with privacy making an impact on their job. So that was the second really big surprise in the data that we had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eI'm guessing that the CMO of OpenAI didn't respond to this. Because they just had a they had a major ChatGPT data breach that we covered, giving away some personal and financial information. And hey, it happens, right? Doesn't mean they're super concerned about it. But it happens. It's still out there for sure.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, you know, there's movements to get that privacy law, that comprehensive privacy law in the United States, I think at that point, that'll be a time to kind of where it ramps back up, you know, right now, I get it, there's a lot of hodgepodge state privacy regulations that CMOs are just OK, here's another one, here’s Maine, here’s New Hampshire.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;I think also, Dom, that they've seen it coming for a long time, a lot of organizations, if they're doing business in Europe, they're multinational or global at all, they kind of have to take the strictest regions' privacy regulations, that's actually what they have to adopt, to continue to do business. You know, a lot of organizations have to demonstrate to the EU that they're already there. Even if you know the bulk of their business might be in the US, if they want to do business in Europe, they've got a play ball, as it were. And so this has been something that's been on their radar for a really long time. And it's no longer I would say, spooking them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e So for me, I think that one of the big reasons that we see less concern about this is that over the last couple years, I think they've made strides in the technology and tools that organizations use to manage this. There's as-a-service kinds of platforms that can be used. And of course, as more and more organizations rush to get GDPR compliant, and California Privacy Act compliant, they're increasingly familiar with these regulations. And, you know, I think that this is something that marketers are a little bit desensitized to, at this point, because they've been steeped in working in this for quite a bit now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah:\u003c/strong\u003e I would agree. And I think you, you're totally onto something there with the technology kind of lending a helping hand in this area. We have seen a really remarkable shift over the last three years, in terms of how well people say that their tools are working. So if we go all the way back kind of the Dark Ages of 2019. It's a really small percentage of CX professionals and marketers who said that their tools were working well. And really small, I'm talking like 9%, who said that their tools were working well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then what we see over the course of the pandemic, and the adoption, and having to use those channels in those platforms a lot more is we see a larger and larger percentage of marketers who say that those tools are working well. And it's been, you know, kind of like a 180 shift.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we're completely on the other side of it now, with the majority of marketers saying that their tools are at least satisfactory, getting the job done, and not so much that they're problematic or need work. So the tools are probably really been helping out here to increase capabilities for marketers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eAll right, let's wrap things up.

When you were talking about metrics. I always say if I had known I would have spent so much time in Excel working with data, I would have majored in something besides women's studies. So I actually came to software, sort of a really roundabout way. I was previously working in finance, had taken some time off, came back to work. And I was looking for a job at my previous company, their job description said, “we're looking for a writer and we serve free lunch.” And I was like, well, I can write and I sure do like lunch. So that's actually how I got into software.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Wow.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa:\u003c/strong\u003e Yep.

And so because I worked so closely with our customers, they had asked me to kind of step up and lead that. And so that's how I ended up in the exciting world of customer experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eIsn't that crazy of customer experience professionals, the path is just not straight.

And I've had a tendency to sort of find those people throughout the organization and bring them over. But I definitely see as we're hiring now, there's definitely a deeper bench of CX professionals than there were when I started. And it's exciting to see all the new programs, training and customer experience. I went through one myself a couple of years ago.

Yeah…but it's like, hey, our customers are happy. “Yeah, but what does it really say?: Everyone gets you on something. And in the journalism world, we're always measured, you know, I mean, I think I shared something that was really exciting about a tweet or something I put out and it was getting a lot of love. And someone in the company said “yeah, but is it getting engagement on the website?” Don't be a buzzkill. Come on, come enjoy this to vanity tweet, you know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa:\u003c/strong\u003e You can't enjoy it. You gotta look at the bigger picture with metrics, unfortunately,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e I know and you being a leader in your organization and CX you are constantly being measured and asked by, you know, folks that care about the bottom line. So let's get into three metrics, three high level metrics that you care a lot about. Let's start with churn. OK, because how important is that one?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa:\u003c/strong\u003e Obviously, you mean the number that gives me nightmares? Yes, absolutely churn. So here at Luxion, our product KeyShot is 3D visualization software. And so it is really one of those products that a lot of our customers will — they'll learn it as a student when they're in school for industrial design, and then become really faithful to it. And so we've been in the middle of transitioning from perpetual to subscription. So really, churn is sort of that number that I wouldn't say it's the one metric to rule at all for me, but it is one of the metrics that rule it all for me. And with churn in particular, it's where you really see those hard truths about your customer happiness, because you can hide it all you want behind NPS scores, because that's just a subset. But churn is really where the rubber meets the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e In your past experiences, organizations, is churn like it's just automatic. Does every CX leader have to be closely watched and churn? And if not, is there a good compelling reason that that's not top of mind for them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know, it's interesting with churn, I think you can look at it a couple of different ways. Maybe you're looking at your net revenue retention, you're looking at your gross revenue retention. But in the end, I mean, you always sort of expect there's going to be some level of churn. And I think as customer experience leaders, we're always sort of striving towards that zero churn. But in reality, you're never really going to hit zero, right? Because you're always going to have companies that might be going out of business priorities change, so you're never going to hit that 100% retention, although I think we all sort of always strive for that. But it really does keep the focus on the customer. I really think that's why churn is one of those metrics that we watched so closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd obviously, this comes down to good tools, right? So you need to have that base — that foundation. So what are some of the platforms like those foundational have to have, if this system blew up, in my day, I will lose my mind kind of thing. Something that you're just firing up every workday, and it's telling you churn and sort of how does that process work?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa: \u003c/strong\u003eSo for me, we really rely heavily on Salesforce. We're in the middle of transitioning to a new payment platform. So we're building our numbers together from a bunch of different locations right now. But for me, it's really — we live and die in Salesforce, I have a pretty new customer success team. So we're at the point now where we're trying to decide if we need to invest in a customer success platform or continue to use our CRM. But for me, it's our CRM, it's our payments, its NPS, our customer, community, those are the things that I'm always sort of refreshing throughout the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Are the vendors lately doing a good job with letting Melissa Henley tell them her story, going into these demos, these selection processes, these bake-offs, as they call them, and they do a good job of letting you upfront — telling you your needs and kind of taking it from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa:\u003c/strong\u003e Some I wish they would do a better job of you know, I don't necessarily want to become an expert on every single software platform in the world. And so when you find a vendor that really understands your needs, and tells you what you don't know that you need, those are the ones that I really come back to over and over again, our customer advocacy platform. Influitive is one of those, I feel like they're really on the cutting edge of customer advocacy and providing features I didn't even know I needed before I asked for them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut on the flip side, they're also really good about listening to feedback. So we are really heavy users of the discussions feature. And so when we have feedback based on what we're hearing from customers, what we're noticing, it's they're always really available to have someone from product management hop on the call set up calls with anyone in the organization. So I think especially those of us that work in customer experience, like we really notice when there's a good customer experience. And on the flip side, we really notice when the customer experience is suboptimal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, right. All right, so let's give the one big takeaway for churn. If I were a customer experience leader, and I was tasked with improving that — it's just been a bad quarter — things are not going well. Like where do I start trying to flip the script on a bad churn number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa:\u003c/strong\u003e I'll give a piece of advice, and I've written about this in my columns more than once over the years. It's a piece of advice from the founder of the previous company I worked at — and she would always say focus on the customer, and the money will follow that if you're making decisions based on money, customers can sense that and will like sort of recoil from it. But if you're making decisions with your customer in mind that you're really keeping their needs front and center, the money will naturally flow from that. So I would say if you're really having issues with churn, take a step back and think about the customer — really think about — what are they facing? And what changes have you made? Are they addressing sort of driving revenue? Or are they addressing solving for the customers needs, and that should put you on a pretty good path forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/top-customer-experience-metrics-that-impact-internal-operations/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Top Customer Experience Metrics That Impact Internal Operations\"\u003eTop Customer Experience Metrics That Impact Internal Operations\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eUnderstanding and Leveraging Net Revenue Retention for Customer Success\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Awesome. All right, and this next one, we're going to talk about metric two of three that you're super laser-focused on. And I'm going to take a deep breath on this, Melissa, because I'm from Boston. And when I say this acronym people probably won't understand. So I'll say it how I say it first. And then we'll say it like how the rest of the world says it. So it's NRR. That's how I that's how I say it. In the real world. It's called N ar, ar, I had to take a deep breath to pronounce my R there. Can you define that? Tell us what it stands for, kind of give us the big picture of what it is. For those who might even be experiencing this for the first time. Possibly, you never know who's listening in the podcast world, and then just lay the foundation of how you approach it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa:\u003c/strong\u003e Sure, absolutely. So NRR, which always makes me feel like a pirate, when I say like NRR, to me, it's really the one metric to rule it all. When you're working with subscription customers, because it encompasses churn, you basically take your revenue, and then you subtract your downgrades your cancellations, and then divide it by your revenue, and then you get a percentage. And with net revenue retention, you really want to aim for over 100%, because that shows you're expanding your existing customer base.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, one thing with NRR, there's also on the flip side, there's gross revenue retention, which takes the expansion revenue out. And so you can have to look at both of them, you can't just only focus on NRR, because you can sort of game the system, you can hide some of that churn behind expansion. So say you have 10% of your customers' churn, but you expand one of your largest accounts, then it's going to look like your NRR is great, when in reality, we have an issue going on.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so that's why you can't look at really one metric in isolation. That's why probably today we're talking about three metrics instead of just one. But with NRR, that's really the thing you really want to be focused on is not just what are you selling, but what accounts are you upgrading and expanding? Obviously key for customer success?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, and in the nightmare department how close is NRR for you to churn? Is it giving you as many nightmares are not as much half as much?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa:\u003c/strong\u003e You know, yes and no, I think with NRR, it's one that I really drive home with the customer success managers because it shows the other dimension of how well you're doing your job, like churn shows how well you're keeping customers, but are you keeping them by throwing crazy discounts their way?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo NRR kind of shows that, and it also shows how well you're getting to know your customers, how well you're focused on the customers in terms of recommending features and products that would meet their needs. And, in particular, you know, having that data around adoption, and product usage is really one of those ways that you can push your NRR because you'll basically know what you can recommend in a timely manner to your customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMastering Data Skills and Understanding the Role of NPS and CSAT\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e As you're talking, I'm thinking, do CX leaders need to be basically data scientists? What's that balance? Because, man, you know, things that make customers happy. But at the same time, you have to be able to use a tool that can extract these insights, you have to do it well. Are you like the owner of these tools basically, in your organization?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, we have a business analyst I work with maybe 75% of my reporting needs I can handle on my own, which if you had told me that even 10 years ago, I'd been like, What are you even talking about? I don't know how to run a pivot table. But then I work with him on sort of the 25% that's a little more complex, where I need to tie multiple data sources together, where I'm trying to say like, well, if this then that, and so it's helpful. Do you have to be a data scientist? No, but do you have to be comfortable with data? Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I'm actually typing away to ChatGPT right now to see what it thinks of NRR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Melissa: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, that's good. You can have ChatGPT tell me if I'm wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Exactly. Actually, I just put NRR in there and in ChatGPT says, I'm not sure what you're talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa:\u003c/strong\u003e Oh, so score one for the humans. That's right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e You don't know CX metric Nananananana. So all right, NRR obviously important to you. So give me that one big takeaway on this one the needs to be improved. I'm not quite sure that I'm getting it, I need to show my board something better with this, where do I start?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa:\u003c/strong\u003e I'd say develop cohorts based on value. And so we can't treat all customers the same. Depending on your product type, you probably have a lot of really small customers, that sort of more quantity. And then it's like the 80/20 rule, 80% of your revenue comes from 20% of your customers. And so then you want to make sure you're not treating everyone the same. And that you're really focusing on the needs the you know, your smaller customers, they may be your advocates, your fanatics that are out there spreading the word about your product, where you really want to focus on your larger customers and making sure that new customers and new departments are adopting your product. So that would be kind of my one big takeaway is you can't treat every customer the same. And you really have to know which customer segments are most valuable.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/voice-of-the-customer-voc-much-more-than-a-satisfied-customer/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Voice of the Customer (VoC): Much More Than a Satisfied Customer\"\u003eVoice of the Customer (VoC): Much More Than a Satisfied Customer\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDebating NPS and CSAT: The Power of Storytelling with Data\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eAll right, cool. Done. Two metrics done out of three. And I know you clearly have more than three metrics in your world. But these are the ones that are top of mind at the moment. And the last one, and I feel like these terms, you can just plug into LinkedIn next to like a CCXP person. And you would get 50,000 results within the last month because everyone debates CX leaders love to debate this. And it's the Net Promoter Score and the customer satisfaction score, NPS and CSAT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa: \u003c/strong\u003eYes, NPS and CSAT. Well, you know, I was thinking about this when you were asking if you need to be a data scientist to be in CX. And I don't know that you need to be a data scientist, but you need to be able to tell a story with your data.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I think that's where CSAT and NPS really come into play. Understanding not just who your promoters are, but what are the things that come up over and over and over again, it's easy to maybe tell not the most true story with NPS because it is a percentage of your user base. But if you see the same things coming up over and over, like customers are saying, like, hey, we hate the experience and the product, or we really love this new pricing structure you've come up with. Customers will tell you. It's just a matter of if you're listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e I just wrote in my chat with our producer team, mark what she just said for an audiogram.

Being an editor and managing editor of CMSWire and I can show you the numbers, I can show you our monthly numbers, I can show you the metadata where the content is coming from who's looking at it when. But I can't tell you a story if I just show you the numbers, right. And if I can get some stories out of that data, that's gold for me, that's absolute gold. So with the NPS and CSAT. The debates I was mentioning earlier was well, yeah, it's good. If it's good, that's great. But I don't know it doesn't really give you a full sense of what's going on. So what do you say to that camp? Who says don't use that as your goldstar metric? No, no, no, no, you can't do NPS?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I think there's a reason we're talking about three metrics today instead of one because they all have their place. And I am actually a big fan of NPS. When used properly, you can just plop your score up on the screen and be like we have an NPS of 60. Great job, let's all go home.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what I've been doing recently is every customer that leaves a comment on their NPS survey, whether it's positive or negative, I reach out to them and ask them hey, thanks for being a customer. I'd love to know what you’d do to improve the product or what's your favorite thing about it with our detractors, fortunately, a much smaller group than our promoters. Thank you for your feedback, I want you to know we're taking it seriously. Can you go into more detail about why you point it, you know, because there's things that come up over and over. And granted, I can't be like, OK, 10 people have said this, obviously, it's a trend. But we can use it as an opportunity to really be empathetic with customers and try and understand where they're coming from.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don't know, if you've read the new book that Fred Reichheld wrote \"Winning on Purpose.\" He's the guy who created NPS, but it's all about customer love, which is something I'm really passionate about is showing customers that we value them, we care for them that we love them and want to do the best thing for them. So I think that's where NPS really shines is a way to find those people. Because if someone's willing to spend the time to leave you a comment, they either really love you or really don't. And either way, as a CX leader, you should be reaching out and finding out why they feel the way they do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eEngaging with Customers on a Personal Level\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e That's another great audiogram right there. Because you hear that all the time in these podcasts, and CX Decoded on CMSWire.com. CX leaders, consultants, they all say talk to your customers more. So I would love for you, Melissa to visualize that for me and put it into action. Like how do you do that? Say, where are you looking at those NPS comments and how do you actually reach out to them? Is that like a personal email that you send.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eWow. I love it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa:\u003c/strong\u003e It is customer's personal email I said, and you'd be surprised how many people respond to it. Wow, someone's actually, you know, because I mean, as a CX leader, I will respond to every customer experience survey I get, because I'm like, somewhere on the other end, there's someone on their CX team is like, Thank God, someone filled this out. But I have time blocked out on my calendar on Fridays, usually, which are my slower days, and I spend about an hour just sending emails and you know, hey, I just want to introduce myself wanted to thank you for taking the time to give us your comments, basically addressing their concerns, inviting them to feel free to reach out to me if I can help with anything. And in general, at that point, I'll pass them off to their customer success manager. But to me, I think it makes a difference showing that from the highest levels of our company, we care about our customers, we care about what they're saying, we care about their feedback, we care about addressing their concerns, even if it's not positive. It's easy to respond to people who love you like who doesn't like that. But it's actually listening to people that have feedback that maybe you don't want to hear, that ends up being really beneficial for the entire organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eI'll tell you right now, that data that you get from those anecdotes, and those email conversations, I'm telling you, I think that's better than any CX tool out there, to show what the customers are directly saying to you. In a conversation like that. That's amazing. I think if I'm a board of director, I would love to see something like that what the customers are actually saying, versus just another fancy chart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa: \u003c/strong\u003eWell it ties right into everything we're doing with our customer advocacy program. So we launched a new customer community about six months ago. And our goal was we wanted to get more actionable feedback from customers really give them an opportunity to influence our decisions, give us feedback on what they love in the product, what they would improve, because the people who are going to be the best at telling you how you can improve are the people who are in your product every single day. And we have been blown away by the engagement with our new forums, we went from about 1% of users being engaged to over 40% of our users being actively engaged and just to be able to stand in front of the board or even my boss and say, Look, these are comments people are giving us they're saying that they want to improve the feature. And this is all such valuable feedback. And it's really rewarding. I've always felt as someone in customer experience, the thing I should be spending the most time doing outside of managing my team is interacting with customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Power of NPS and CSAT: Embracing Customer Feedback\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e And it's amazing, because, you know, I think it's so hard to wrangle people and convince them to give you money, right to begin with. But it's twice as hard to give you their time. And I feel that right. I feel that because matter of fact, with folks like you, Melissa, I can't tell you how much I appreciate the contributors of CMSWire because they are literally giving me the gift of their time. I know how hard it is to get in front of a computer, not distracted and write something, That is so hard. So convincing customers to do that after they made a purchase. Like you said earlier, when they're doing that they deserve a major kudos no matter if it's negative, or positive or neutral. Is this customer happy or sad? I can't tell. So that's why you email them, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's true. And it goes back to something one of my mentors used to say to me, which was the greatest gift you can get is a customer complaining. And at that time in my career is like what are you talking about? Like, no, we don't want any complaints. You know, if someone's complaining, or even if someone's taking the time to provide positive feedback is when you stop getting that, that's when you should be concerned. Because if someone's complaining, they still care. And the opposite of love isn't hate. The opposite of love is basically apathy. And so when customers stop talking to you, that's when you need to be concerned. And so my hope is that by really reaching out, you know, I do the same thing with customers who churn I reach out to them and ask them about their experience, ask them how we can improve. And with customers that renew, I can't obviously do every one, but I pick a couple and then just reach out to them to hear. What are we doing well, where could we improve? How can we keep delivering a better experience to our customers? I mean, because really in the end, that's what my job is?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eGenerative AI and the Continued Importance of Human Involvement in CX and Marketing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. Alright, let's put the final stamp on this metric that you care about greatly. NPS CSAT. Talk to me if I'm a detractor of it. And I'm not convinced to buy into it quite yet. What do you say to me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa:\u003c/strong\u003e I'd say I find people who think that often are using that as their only metric. And if you look at NPS as sort of one piece of your customer health puzzle, it has a place and if you're really focused on love and customers loving you, you loving your customers, you can really track your trends over time. The other thing I'd say is that just understand that it isn't the whole little picture, but it should be part of your picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e All right metrics aside, thank you for that. Melissa, I want to finish up with again, we cannot let you off the hook without a generative AI ChatGPT conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, I have a funny story about this. So I was thinking about, you know, generative AI. And I said, you know, I'm gonna ask ChatGPT what it thinks the benefits of generative AI are for customer success. And I would like to report it was almost 100% the same, which I don't know if that's good for me or good for the AI but either way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, exactly. No, I asked the same question. I think I said, what customer experience outcomes can generative AI create? And I put the same question in from marketing to and I think ChatGPT gets lazy. Sometimes I think It cheats. It's like, I'm going to do the same takeaways, but I'm going to put in marketing where I put in customer experience, you know, it does that. So it's like, yeah, you're copying humans a little bit there with the laziness factor. I like it, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, it's interesting. I was thinking about like, what would my one takeaway about generative AI be? And it's kind of that we still need humans. And it may get you like, 80% of the way there, but you still need a human to read it and make sure is it striking the right tone? Is it pulling the right information out? Is it being lazy? So there's still a place where you can I think it can help you get rid of some of the tedious work, and that volume work, but you still need humans at the end of it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/chatgpt-is-all-the-rage-but-dont-stop-learning-just-yet/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ChatGPT Is All the Rage but Don't Stop Learning Just Yet\"\u003eChatGPT Is All the Rage but Don't Stop Learning Just Yet\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Value (and Challenges) of Training and Vetting AI Systems for Customer Experience\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, you really do. I mean, I just yesterday, I put in a comprehensive report with a lot of data in there was a PDF, but it was online, so it can look at it. And you need to check because it made up some stats that weren't there. Like I think its algorithms that got thrown off where it analyzed the doc, but then it grabbed some stuff that already knew and kind of combined those a little bit, I think, because it wasn't in there. I looked at the takeaways at 82% of xxx, and I did Ctrl F 82. Not in the report, that percentage literally wasn't in the report, and it said it was. So you are spot on, it needs the human touch, no question about it. Now, let's ask you this. You've told me in the past that you actually are finding some successes with ChatGPT. In your customer experience outcomes. What's the tangible outcome so far?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa: \u003c/strong\u003eWe're still sort of in our infancy of using ChatGPT. But I think where it's been really helpful is in sort of, where we have a large number of things we have to do we have a lot of emails we have to write, we have a lot of call scripts we need to create, and it can kind of take away some of how much time would it take for you to research everything. And I know because I just rewrote all our customer templates. And that takes time. And so with the generative AI, it can kind of take a little bit of that time away. The other place I'm really excited about it is with self service bots. So I oversee our support team. And so there's a lot of possibilities there. We're just starting to explore with giving customers faster service, using all the data we already have at our fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and implementing these tools comes with a lot of concerns. And like you said, ethical issues and stuff like that, if you were to hire a human being that worked for you, 24/7 and answered questions to everyone ever, all the time, you would vet that employee prospective employee for six months, but you wouldn't let them in the door until you knew everything about them. Same thing has to happen, that vetting really needs to happen with these AI systems, no matter how cool and fast they are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa:\u003c/strong\u003e It's interesting, we've been working on a bot for our Support Platform, and I sort of had this idea, it would just be like plug and play, but you really have to train it. And it takes a lot of effort to point it to the right information, train it on the right information, get it to respond in the right tone. So at a certain point is like is this ever going to be worth it, but it can be it just, I certainly did not expect the training part of the AI to be so involved. And I think that's where it's interesting that a lot of companies like Salesforce, ChurnZero, others are adding AI into their product, where they've kind of done the training for you. And so I'm interested to see where that's gonna go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eThis has been amazing. We get the metrics downpat, we get your thoughts on generative AI. Let's just finish with one quick takeaway. Maybe not a takeaway, but a vision for this time next year. What's one thing you would love to have accomplished? If we're having the same conversation next year at this time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMelissa:\u003c/strong\u003e I don't know how long do you have because I could just reiterate my presentation to the board. One of the reasons I joined Luxion is because everyone here is just obsessed with customers. And as someone in customer experience, that's what you want. You don't have to sort of transform the organization to reorient around the customer. And that's exciting for me. I mean, My past company was like that as well, very customer focused. And so I think if I were here next year, the one thing I would have wanted to accomplish is really start reflecting some of our customer obsession and customer love in a lot of the experiences our customers have with us whether it's purchasing or renewal, or logging into the product for the first time, and we're getting there. And there's a lot of exciting things we're working on. So that would be what I would say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Okay, great.

You know, I think it's fair to say they're in the GOAT conversation for CMSWire contributors, they were named CMSWire Contributors of the Year for 2022. And here we are in 2023. They're already contributing more content, and our contributors are awesome. They just contribute from the field, talking about CX issues, marketing, and we love it. And these two are going to talk about some personal experiences they've had as consumers, and how that relates to the business world and how we can do better basically in CX.

Looking forward to having a spirited conversation here today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e We are, there’s gonna be all kinds of spirit going on here today for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustin:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eThat's right. That's right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, the day this recording is Valentine's Day. So if I sound extra giddy, just excuse me, it's my favorite holiday of all time. I'm just so into it. So bear with me. Nichole, let's start with you with just an introduction, what you're all about. And I know you were in your past world before you were a consultant, you were a CX practitioner, a CX leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNichole: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I've actually spent the last 10 years in the CX world developing all sorts of customer programs. And now you know, I'm very blessed to be able to consult and help multiple companies really beef up their customer journey — and in some cases, start out their customer journey. And I just feel like this industry is growing. It's been so much fun and so exciting to bring my personal experiences into it, and just see everybody thrive in this space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. And your role seems like it's perfect now because you have that combination of, hey, I used to practice this and do it like you. And I'm also happy to be a consumer of things. So I see things now a lot clearer. So good vantage point for you. And Justin, at Perficient, you know, longtime CMSWire contributor, thank you again, let's bring our listeners up to speed on what your focus area is now in your role and how you got there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustin:\u003c/strong\u003e Sure, yeah. Well, I'm sort of a lifelong ecommerce and customer experience veteran, I'll say, since I graduated college, it's kind of been the space that I've operated in. But yeah, I really focus in on customer experience with the clients that we work with, obviously, but more so just really kind of honed in on the experiences that we all as consumers have in our daily lives and how we can have relatable pieces of information that brands can take away. And if you pay attention in your daily life, there's tons of things that you can learn and apply to what you're working on or your personal life. So that's kind of the perspective I try to take with my articles at CMSWire. And I think brands should definitely look at that as well, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePositive Workplace Cultures and the Impact on CX\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, and that's why each of you here today, thought you were the perfect combination of using those personal experiences and living them, breathing them and remembering them and writing about them. So it's like a great formula. And there’s lessons learned for CX leaders who read CMSWire.com. So that's what we're gonna do today, we're gonna talk about some of the articles you guys have written — and some key lessons learned. So we'll start off with Nichole, and Justin feel free to pipe in after she kind of gives us the lay of the land with what she was going for — the first one, Nichole was talking about \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/customer-experience-meets-community-experience-lessons-from-overseas/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Customer Experience Meets Community Experience\"\u003eCustomer Experience Meets Community Experience\u003c/a\u003e, and I believe this happened overseas. I know you're like a seasoned traveler, you make me jealous, jealous of all the articles you write about your travel adventures, but in the travel adventures, you get some huge, huge CX takeaways. So what was this one about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNichole:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so my other half and I we were traveling through Scotland, and Scotland — if anybody's been there — knows that hospitality is huge there. They're just the kindest people. and I've had a few really positive experiences, but one that's always really stuck out to both of us actually. And it's it's prompting us to go back in 2024 to make a pit stop in Edinburgh is this Michelin star restaurant that we went to that's in a bed and breakfast.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you would think, of course, you know, it's Michelin star, it should have great service. And actually, that's not always the case. This is very much is about Scottish tradition. And, but it's more than that. It's — we start talking to the host, he's a fantastic guy. And I asked him, you know, what got you into the hospitality industry, just even at the start, nevermind the fact that it's a restaurant. And he said that he loves the owner, that the owners had other restaurant locations, they’re different concepts, they all sit within these very small boutique bed and breakfasts. And he just loved how he was treated or has been treated, he's still there, by the owner of these concepts.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as we started to discuss more about it, he started talking about how he started out at you know, another location, and couldn't wait until a position had opened at the restaurant that we were at because the staff just loves working there. The team loves working there, the team loves each other, the team loves the owner. And so the takeaway for me from this was, you know, CX isn't just about what we provide out to the customer. It's what we provide each other as employees, co-workers, whatever you want to call it, and how that's going to reverberate out to the customer.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so when you see someone so happy to be working for a place, it becomes part of the customer experience. And for us, I mean, it was so memorable, the staff was so incredible, we could have had the worst food in the world, and we still would have come back. I mean, the food was fantastic, but but we would have come back. And it's it's just because of that energy that was radiating from them. And that positivity that I think we take for granted in our daily working lives and the people that we work with and manage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/the-importance-of-positive-emotional-connections-with-customers/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Importance of Positive Emotional Connections With Customers\"\u003eThe Importance of Positive Emotional Connections With Customers\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCX and EX Metrics Should Be Combined for More Comprehensive Insights\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eThat brings up a point of EX meeting CX, right, we always talk about it, we've had editorial themes about it, employee experience meets customer experience. And it's so easy to say, and you're showing us an example of an actually in action. And for that industry, too, service to actually be inspired by your team. Love your boss. That's rare, isn't it? Right? In that kind of industry? Because it's like a ruthless industry, with customers in your face all day. Justin, are you seeing that in any of your experiences with organizations like the importance of employee experiences? Does it come up in like these gigs, where you're talking to companies and CX leaders, or they talk about employee experience a lot?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustin: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely — 100%. It's one of the emerging areas that we're seeing our clients focus on this year to all the points that Nichole had just alluded to, you know, I mean, when you have an employee, and I think I wrote an article about this last year, I think it was Walmart or somewhere else where …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Oh, that Justin was his name, maybe … no no. That's your name. What was the name of the employee, Scott? I forgot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustin: \u003c/strong\u003eChris. \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/be-like-chris-empower-social-employee-personality-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Be Like Chris\"\u003eBe Like Chris\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Chris, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustin:\u003c/strong\u003e But at any rate, it's totally true. And Nichole's story is a perfect example of that, where when you see employees who are so passionate about what they do day in and day out, it inspires you to want to come back and be a part of that experience because it's like, Hey, look at this guy. He's over here. He's running around, but he's having the time of his life. And you know what, it enhances the experiences that we have, as customers at that restaurant, and makes us want to come back and get to know more about that person and who he is and what his story is, and how he got to the spot, and what his real true drivers are behind that passion.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if you can tap into that, as a brand, the ROI metrics can be through the roof, right? Because that's how you develop positive \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/building-a-next-level-customer-loyalty-program/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"customer loyalty\"\u003ecustomer loyalty\u003c/a\u003e. And you keep people coming back. It's because of the employees that you have within your business and empowering them to be spokespeople and also interact with customers is just a no brainer in 2023.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I’ve been thinking about metrics. I think we need a metric for the two like a combined metric. I know there's eNPS and then regular NPS, CSAT and all that. Nichole, is there any employee experience meets CX metric? I don't think so yet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNichole:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, no, I don't think there's a combined one. I mean, I think the closest you can probably get as a CSAT score, right, that would at least give a little bit of an indication as to how the employees are feeling, right, within their organization and how much they enjoy working there. But no, I don't think there's a combined one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. Because you wonder, right? Does Netflix have a great employee experience? And does Amazon because, you know, their customer experience is through the roof. It's awesome. Right? It's easy, it's easy to use, and tools are great. But you wonder if they look at that closely, EX, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustin:\u003c/strong\u003e They should and I would imagine that they are because they're somewhat you know, will say that they're their quote unquote leaders in the CX space which can be debated right. I think in some areas they are and other areas they're not but they definitely should be tracking that because not only is it important for employees to be passionate and excited and be good at what they are doing because that helps the right customers convert, which is important, but what is the value? Or what is the cost of trying to rehire an employee that is as passionate as the folks that you have today. And that cost can be massively higher than you'd want it to be right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you don't want to let the folks go that you have that are passionate about your brand, and it comes in, you know, you have to kind of take that into account and make sure you're constantly taking care of the folks that are servicing your customers, in addition to taking care of your customers. So the pendulum swings both ways. You kind of have to try to find the balance, but you really need to make sure that both customers and employees are having good experiences at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eGood or Bad, Customers Remember How They Were Treated\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e All right. CMSWire contributor article number two up for discussion. This one's Justin's — \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/the-customer-experience-secret-amazon-doesnt-want-you-to-know-about/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Customer Experience Secret Amazon Doesn't Want You to Know About\"\u003eThe Customer Experience Secret Amazon Doesn't Want You to Know About\u003c/a\u003e — what a leading, intriguing title there that that editors just love. Thank you, Justin. So what's this one about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustin:\u003c/strong\u003e This is a great story. So a few years back, I think it was either last year or the year before I was attending a New Year's Eve event down here in Austin, Texas, that was put on by some of my friends who I actually mentioned in an article that went live today. And the theme of the event was like a gold and black sort of New Year's Eve party. And I needed a gold velvet jacket. Right? Which is, you know ..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e That’s what I'm wearing right now.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustin: \u003c/strong\u003ePretty stylish, right? Exactly. So of course, like any good consumer, I turned to the internet and Google and tried to find the best gold jacket that's out there that's velvet, which is somewhat unique.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd sure enough, I found a few different websites that I might venture to say are a little bit more than sketchy and decided that I found a jacket that was perfect. It was nothing like I'd ever seen before. I said this is going to go great with my outfit. I'm going to crush it on the dance floor for New Year's Eve, order the jacket on the site, right and had no indication that there was any stock issues. It said it was in stock, order was placed, great.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd come to find out a few days later — I didn't receive any sort of order update or FedEx or UPS tracking number. And I said, What the heck's going on here? Where's my gold jacket? And sure enough, I reached out — I had to proactively reach out to this business. And they said, Oh, we don't have that jacket anymore. I said, Okay, well, why is it on your site? And why does it say that it's in stock? And they couldn't give me an answer.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong story short, I only had three or four days to find another gold velvet jacket to purchase and ultimately turned to Amazon, which of course, you know, their reliability and inventory is always 99%. It's good, right? There's some occasions where you don't receive things, but for the most part, they're very good, especially if you're Prime. So I ended up having to order the jacket through Amazon, it arrived on time, I crushed it on the dance floor, of course, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, we don't know that we didn't see it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustin:\u003c/strong\u003e Okay, all right. That's true. There might be video evidence out there somewhere. But we'll, we'll leave that for another day. But the moral of the story is that I don't even remember the name of the company that I started this search with and I placed the order with. In fact, that I left my mind as quickly as possible because I've never wanted to purchase with them again because they didn't exceed my expectations.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to the site, it looked a little sketchy, but it said that the product was in stock, it would ship same day, and I would receive it in two, three business days. Fine. However, after I placed the order, no proactive reach out, didn't have any sort of order status update, and I had to resort to finding it on Amazon.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the moral of the story is that the real secret that Amazon has is their product detail pages haven't changed in like 15 or 20 years. They all look the same. But they're so good at inventory management and order management, you know, you're going to get what you place when they say that you're going to get it in most cases they exceed that expectation. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd that is a big reason why people go and shop on Amazon. It's not because the site looks good, which is what we typically think about with good customer experience or good experience design, right? It's because of how they've set their business up and how they exceed delivery expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. And now folks, we have these two parables, I guess I'll call them these two little tales from each contributor here are spot on because Nichole's was a good experience. And here she is months and months later, still talking about it. Justin's was a bad experience. And here he is, months and months talking about it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the point being, we remember how we are treated. That's what being a human is. Nichole, customer experience leaders — do enough of them recognize this, that how the experience is how you are treated. And I think you're gonna talk about this a little later, like showing just a little bit of decency. You know, these experiences are just hammering this point home of you remember how you were treated?\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMeeting Customer Expectations Is Crucial for Success\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNichole: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. And you know, I think as CX leaders individually, I can't speak for everybody but individually. We all want a great human experience. Right? I think when it comes to specific organizations and how they perceive customer experience, you start to get a lot of other opinions in the room that start to dictate the direction that a customer experience journey is going to go in a lot of times, and I mean, this is a departure from every single experience I've had.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere have been times where they've tried to influence me, I say they, previous organizations have tried to influence me on how I run programs. And as a CX leader, yes, you have to satisfy a lot of different people. But ultimately, you're kind of the linchpin for how well revenue could go, how well recurring revenue is going to go, right. It just, there's so much that's riding on it that I think a lot of people forget about, a lot of times people see numbers and they go great, we're not hitting our numbers, you need to send out more emails, well, that's probably the last thing you need to do.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that's just an example. But it's that panic mode. And us as CX leaders have to kind of remain in this space, of being calm, trusting what we're doing, trusting that as humans, we know what we're doing. And that it's ultimately going to lead to positive outcomes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what you've alluded to actually, with another experience, which I'm sure we'll get to is what happens when the customer ends up providing that experience. And that's like the best thing a CX leader could actually be a part of right, because then all of a sudden, people are creating their own great experiences from something that you might not have been able to create for them. So it's just a fascinating thing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's why I always write about the human aspect of things, because that is the most important. I've had things go horribly wrong when it wasn't human to human contact. And I've had amazing experiences when humans were involved. So, you know, we all need to kind of keep that in mind as leaders that we're all humans doing human things in this world. And we all need to treat each other as such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Justin, I want to get back to you on that specific issue, the breakdown of that company had because you deal with this a lot in the commerce space. What happened? Like, why does this happen? Because to me, that's like the magic moment, someone gave you money. And you just abandon the ship. After that, like, how does that happen? What in your experience is the most common breakdowns that these commerce leaders the CX leaders have?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it's a great point. And I think it really kind of starts with brands, who maybe aren't as mature, who are looking to kind of move into the space and sell their gold jackets, for lack of better terminology, right. And they might have really great gold jackets, and it might be their specialty, maybe they're in a few locations throughout the country, right. But they're not set up with an infrastructure that is conducive of supporting a good customer experience, i.e., if someone walks into their store, let's say that they're based in California, sure, they can deliver a great experience, they see the gold jacket that's on the shelf, they can try it on, someone can walk out great.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you know, that's only one aspect of their business, you know, you talk about truly being \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/10-steps-to-business-growth-using-omnichannel-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"omnichannel with customer experience\"\u003eomnichannel with customer experience\u003c/a\u003e, you have to be in all the channels that customers are, but you also have to exceed the expectation.

So you have to make sure that your experience is up to par with what the goliaths out there are doing. And I think that's what happens quite a bit is you have people who make really great products, really great gold jackets, but they don't have the business set up in a way that's conducive to what they're trying to achieve on a larger scale.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that's where you can get into trouble. Because you're trying to do too much too soon. You should focus in on building what your business is within your geography and then taking the proactive steps to invest in things like an order management system or other pieces of technology that will allow you to exceed \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/4-ways-digital-evolution-has-changed-customers-ideas-about-patience/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"customer expectations\"\u003ecustomer expectations\u003c/a\u003e as you sell on a broader scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Kind of walking the walk of what your content promises.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustin:\u003c/strong\u003e Exactly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e They promised you a gold jacket.

And that's from Nichole. In this one. I'm just gonna throw out a timespan here. And then Nichole, you chime in? So here's the deal, as Joe Biden would say, \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/23-minutes-4-seconds-1-canceled-subscription-1-poor-customer-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"customer expectations\"\u003e23 Minutes, 4 Seconds\u003c/a\u003e. What was that about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNichole: \u003c/strong\u003eSo I was canceling my internet, which I think everybody could probably sympathize with, it’s not the easiest thing in the world to do. But this particular company had used chat only — they got rid of their phone numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Ah, channel forcing— channel forcing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNichole:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely. And look, I always say I see both sides, right. I see the side where you've got record of the conversation, you've got receipt that it's been cancelled or whatever the transaction is. And if something goes really wrong, right, that record’s there. The other side of it is we're not training people to do this correctly. And so what I mean by that is my experience was great. Gotta cancel it. Click on cancellation, it said, opens an instant messenger box.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I'm going, Oh, great. This is exactly what I needed today. Because to me, it sounds weird, but I'd rather have my phone next to me on hold with the hold music, which you know if anybody that saw that Budweiser commercial, I think Dom had it on LinkedIn, it was great, wasn't it? I’d rather listen to that, and wait and talk to someone live and get it done quickly. I know that sounds kind of weird considering the fact that you're waiting longer probably than using a chat.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e No, I like it, to jump in. I love waiting. No, I don't love waiting on hold. I don’t mind because I can do world during it. I have to work. If I have to do the chat, you know.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNichole:\u003c/strong\u003e It's a constant fear of Oh, my God, did I close the window? Am I over, I mean, there's so many unknowns. But the thing that's really unfortunate, and you're seeing more companies do this is like I said, the staff isn't being trained properly. So they very much and I've had several experiences, this was probably one of the worst, where it seemed like I was texting with somebody. And the problem that comes along with that is that it's very informal. Things go missing the article that I wrote, I think this was the one that was just posted last week talked about the fact that there were typos, he was chatting with me or he was typing while I was trying to type out my statement, he wasn't paying attention to my request, meaning that all of a sudden, I can tell there was a chatbot that was semi-involved that said, Okay, click cancellation if that's what the customer is asking for. But he must have clicked something else. Because all of a sudden, he's asked me questions as though I'm starting up service.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it wasted 23 minutes and four seconds of my time, when I could have been doing other work while on hold and had the requests completed more efficiently that way than having to go through this I am and only focus on that for that amount of time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eChat-Only Customer Service: A Cost-Saving Measure or a Recipe for Frustration?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e So clearly, that's far too long to cancel your subscription, that should actually be a one call to action. And they should say You sure you're like, yep. See you later. And the whole chatbot thing and I’ll bring Justin in because obviously \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/generative-ai-opportunities-and-challenges-for-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"generative AI\"\u003egenerative AI\u003c/a\u003e has taken off the last three months. And we need a CX leaders to nail this. And we need to capitalize on it in a good way. So what's your take right now, as we stand here with chatbots and customer experience, Justin, are you looking heavily into those experiences right now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustin: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know, they've been around for a while. And Nichole's story is a perfect example of where they can go sideways. So \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/journey-through-time-how-chatbots-have-evolved-over-the-decades/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"chatbots\"\u003echatbots\u003c/a\u003e and AI are great for certain elements. But when someone wants to speak with an actual agent live, you have to give them what they want. And as much as you try to force them through the process, because maybe you don't have people who are ready to take those calls, or for whatever reason it might be, it still is not conducive to what customers are looking to do. And at the end of the day, that's the goal, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo yeah, they are important, they can service some areas, right? Like, if you want to check on your order status, you can put your order number into a chatbot. And it can provide details, right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when you need more complex things done, like Nichole's story, it becomes more and more challenging. And having you know, an actual person to be intervened into that and actually have the historical tribal knowledge of the conversation that's already taken place is just a process plan that needs to happen better internally at that organization. But they do serve a purpose, they can be the frontline defense for customer issues.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when customers are fed up, or they're not getting what they want, you have to be willing to get a live agent in there and exceed the expectation. Because if it's too challenging, again, the name of the game, people aren't going to come back and they're not going to remember who you are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNichole:\u003c/strong\u003e The one thing that concerns me about that. And I'm all for AI and chatbots in situations where you're just inundated with the same kinds of questions over and over again, right? Like, where's my order, things like that. But in a case like this, where you're making somebody jump through hoops to get to what should be a very simple solution. By the time you get a live person on the phone, they're already very frustrated. And then that live support person is dealing with somebody who's very frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt just seems to me and I think there's a lot of kinks that need to be worked out across the board across many different industries. But this is at what point do you go ahead and provide a number. Without it, there's got to be a timestamp on it, right? We just don't have the attention span anymore to wait three minutes to try to find something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustin:\u003c/strong\u003e It's a great point, Nichole. And I think the way that brands should look at doing that is they really need to look at things like customer lifetime value and try to back into analytics around chat to see what is the real tipping point where people get frustrated and don't come back and how can we proactively interject to your point at the time it’s needed. And I think what we fall into a lot, and I'm not trying to slam big brands here, but I think a lot of times folks will implement chatbots or AI, because it's the buzz term in the industry. And if the organization isn't ready to adopt that, and to, Dom, to your point from before, as well as you Nichole, and they don't have the employee experience set up, or they just don't have the metrics or mechanics to actually be successful with it, you shouldn't implement it, you just shouldn't do it, because you're gonna have the experience that you had, Nichole.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes, yeah. So what data tells them to do these things? Why are they channel forcing? Why would that company say, Hey, everybody, guess what? We're abandoning everything except for chat. When it comes to this customer action? Why do they do that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNichole:\u003c/strong\u003e I'm seeing a couple of different things in the industry with it and Justin's right. It's been around a long time. But I think, and I hate using COVID. But COVID is a perfect example of this where everybody's home, you have less support reps, they're inundated. So let's find another solution that would make it easier on everybody. And by the way, there's mental fragility involved, right? When you have a lot of frustrated people, I can understand the need to use chat, because it removes that element. At the same time, it also removes that human experience.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so I think a lot of companies are trying to do more with less, I think it's part budgeting, it's part just mental drain. But at the end of the day, they're also not putting in place the training that's needed, the utilizing data, like usage data, right? Or even just what's that customer conversion like. If none of those things are looked at and studied even market data, then you're not implementing a solution. You're doing it to be reactive. And when you're doing it to be reactive. That's when these things start happening. Like what happened to me.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow Brands Can Capitalize on Nostalgia to Create Lasting Customer Connections\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. All right. Let's go on to an article from Justin. And we're going to talk about \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/cheap-beer-and-recessions-how-to-survive-and-thrive-with-exceptional-customer-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"where you mentioned in your opening paragraph, Keystone Light\"\u003ewhere you mentioned in your opening paragraph, Keystone Light\u003c/a\u003e. That's what we're going to talk about right now. So what do you got? What was that one about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustin:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so this is one of my favorite articles that I think I've kind of put together. And it's really about invoking nostalgia through different brand activities, right. And this is a good story. So after I had graduated college, probably two or three years after all of my college roommates got together, and we decided, Hey, let's go up to our buddy's lake for the weekend. We'll go up there for two or three days. Just kind of have fun. Go out on the water. Take some Jeeps off roading, basically just guys being guys, right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we went up there. And once we got up there, we got settled, we said, hey, let's go pick up some hotdogs and some hamburgers to grill and let's grab some beer, right? So as we're going to do all of this, we go to the liquor store to pick up what we're going to pick up. And we say, Oh man, look there's Keystone Light, we used to drink that in college. Remember that time that Greg did this. Remember that time that Shawn did that? Oh, my goodness, we have to get a 30 pack of this, right. So we did, right? We picked up a 30 pack of I would argue with some of the best beer in the world.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people may not right, decided to go obviously back to our friend's place, had a fantastic weekend, drank all the Keystone beer that we purchased, caught up on memories, and really just kind of went back to those years that we had in college of really finding out who we are as people, what we want to do in life. And it brought us back right. And that is such a powerful thing because brands, all brands have the opportunity to tap into this nostalgia in a way that evokes these \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/11/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"emotions\"\u003eemotions\u003c/a\u003e within us as consumers that brings us back to a time that maybe we're not in now but have fond memories of and every brand has this opportunity. But the ones that really embrace it are going to continue to create customers for life. And a good example of this would be you know, maybe a few years from now I have kids of my own and and 20 years they graduate from college. And maybe I have a Keystone Light with my son or my daughter, right? And it brings you back.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo there's always that opportunity for brands to generate these emotions in a nostalgia and kind of stir it up in a way that creates emotions, which at the end of the day is what brands should want to do. Because we as consumers, when we associate and connotate emotion to a brand, we create that strong and connection that makes us customers for life. So that's my Keystone story. And every time I see Keystone Light anywhere, I always go back and think to my college buddies and in my years in school together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. And that's like combining all those worlds, right? The product, the experience, the environment, the time or your life.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustin:\u003c/strong\u003e Yep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Man to hit that. That's like the jackpot for customer experience right there. If you can combine all those elements every day, every single day, I'm sure that's perfectly happening in your world, Nichole with all the organization you talk to. It's all nostalgic, just like that. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNichole: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. And in fact, it's funny that you bring this up because a couple of months ago it was just a chat with a friend and this isn't going to shock you, Dom. But what if we started our own wine label?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, here she comes with the wine.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNichole:\u003c/strong\u003e Oh gosh, I know, right? I can't leave wine out of a conversation. But we started talking about it and going well, you know, where the the downfall always is really has to do with that kind of branding and identifying with it and creating those kind of memories, and the fact that nobody really ever capitalizes on it the way that they should. And there are so many simple ways to do it through social media or through just having commercials that allude to creating those kinds of memories, we see a few of them, but not really.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that kind of brand identification for life. I mean, I still have them, I'll see you, you know, nostalgia, things that you'll see on Instagram, like, you know, a kid of the 80s, or whatever, you see all these toys, and it just brings you back to those really fond memories. And going gosh, you know, if I can still play with, I don't know, a ViewMaster today, or Legos or whatever, it evokes the same kind of experience. And that's what creates not just a customer for life, but generations of customers as what Justin has just said.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo to me, they’re just prime for the picking. I don't think that there is one single company out there that couldn't at least take a stab at it. I don't care if it's cybersecurity, or if it's something totally obscure, it should be memorable. That's what we want to remember, right? We want to remember the good times experiential marketing is a huge piece of that, obviously, you know, anytime that we can interact with a brand that's going to surprise and delight, they're gonna have us for quite some time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I felt that way. When the Superbowl commercial for the Air Jordans movie came out. with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Such a good one. I'm like, it rocked my soul when I saw that, because it brought everything back. The desire to get an Air Jordan back then, to have it to feel. Now granted, I never got past the junior varsity level at Gloucester High School in Mass in basketball.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Michael Jordan was in the NBA, and he's the best ever. But in those shoes, you better bet I was Michael Jordan. Okay. And that that's a brand that's smart. Because they're coming back with a movie they know a bunch of 45 year olds like me are gonna go see it opening night. I will be there. So that is a good customer experience. Right? Good marketing? I should say really?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustin: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it is. And it just provides, you know, as think as everyone knows, the secondhand market for Nikes and vintage shoes are again, it plays right, exactly into the nostalgic part of it. But you know, vintage is back, it's been back for a while and you're right, you're not going to be the only one showing up to watch the premiere in Jordans, I can guarantee you that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article: \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/create-a-positive-emotional-connection-for-a-better-customer-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Create a Positive Emotional Connection for a Better Customer Experience\u0026amp;nbsp;\"\u003eCreate a Positive Emotional Connection for a Better Customer Experience\u0026nbsp;\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCreating a Sense of Community and Empathy in Customer Experience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Let's wrap things up. We're about the time where we like to finish up, we should go forever. This is really fun in the producers in the back and giving you all kinds of thumbs up, by the way, all kinds you guys. So you're doing great. Let's finish with this. So Nichole, you did tease one final article earlier in the year you wanted to mention and that was so why don’t you give us some quick final takeaways on kind of something that really sums things up, just being empathetic. And that's \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/a-forgotten-customer-experience-art-decency/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"the focus on the column here about being just a decent brand and decent people.\"\u003ethe focus on the column here about being just a decent brand and decent people.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNichole: \u003c/strong\u003eI was on a flight actually heading to Europe traveling over the fall. And it was the first leg out to three. And this father behind me had a son that had some special needs. And you can tell that the rest of the passengers that were boarding were getting a little concerned because the boy was screaming, and it's hard to settle him down. And it's a new experience. So it's obviously very difficult. And they were sitting in the middle and the window seat. And a woman who was in a business suit came down the aisle and sat in her seat right next to them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you know, everybody just kind of held their breath, because it is that tense moment of going, oh my gosh, she just came from a business meeting. Well, she let the father know, look, I'm a mother, I understand if there's anything I can do to help you please let me know. And throughout the duration of the flight and this was across the country from Phoenix to Dulles. She was great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt put everybody else at ease on the plane, everybody was smiling. Other people were trying to help the father. And so if you had to go to the restroom, you know, the son had other people paying attention that were kind of keeping them entertained. And everybody got off that flight happy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the whole point of that article was to say, you know, one human can make a difference, even in a brand. And this is what I was alluding to was the fact that, you know, we can do so much as CX leaders, but sometimes it's the customers that are going to create that experience that we just can't create. It's just kind of a natural synergy that happens. And when that happens, that can take a brand from something that maybe was subpar to all of a sudden something that's fantastic because they look at the clientele and say, Well, gosh, this is the kind of clientele that I would prefer to be around or prefer to be a part of that brand community. Right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I always take that into account too that you know, when we look at ourselves as CX leaders, we have to look at ourselves as humans and how we treat other humans. It's what's going to help excel that brand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eI love it. Great tale. Great tale about that because you're right, you're right, that moment you're like something's going down. Something's going down. And it was surprised you because it’s the exact opposite. And for brands to take a lesson out of that that's huge. And you mentioned the word brand community. And I want to turn it to Justin for a final thought on his final article, brand community. You talked about that \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/is-music-the-ultimate-community-experience-connector-id-hit-play-on-that-track/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"in the article that debuted on Feb. 14, with the music community down there in Austin,\"\u003ein the article that debuted on Feb. 14, with the music community down there in Austin,\u003c/a\u003e you talked about that in early article, too. So the communal side of customer experience you call it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustin: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. And I think it kind of ties in pretty well to what Nichole was just alluding to, and that is the fact that brands need to recognize that just because you're manufacturing a product and selling it, it doesn't really stop there, right? It's the community of people who are engaging with a product afterwards where it extends even further. And people who are buying the product want to be around like-minded people who enjoy the same brand, or whatever it is that they purchase.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo yeah, I mean, I had an article that came out today, Feb. 14, on some friends down here who run a event and community based organization called Secret Disco Society that's focused on connecting people and communities through live music and events. I basically kind of talked in that article around, you know, you can go to live music shows and venues, which everyone loves to do, and they're great times, but how often do you really meet people there at that show, and leave the show as friends or have follow ups and say, Hey, we should get together and get a coffee sometime, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn't happen that often. You might go to shows with friends, right? But you don't necessarily meet new people. And what's cool about what they're doing is that they're fostering the live music pieces, but they're doing it in a way that says, hey, go out and meet a new person make a new connection. If you're going to this, you know, if you like rock music, or you like EDM, electronic type music, there's other people that are going to be at this event that are into the same stuff you are right. So make a new connection, you might make a new friend, you might even find your future significant other right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I think that's something that's super important that brands should look at is the product is just a vehicle for connection and community. And if brands can embrace that, they're going to tap into something that will create again, generations, as Nichole alluded to, which was perfect of new customers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I think that's an important piece to realize that just after realizing that once the purchase is complete, that's really where the customer experience journey starts.

Gentlemen, it's great to have you on. I'm gonna throw it over to Dave from Sitecore. First I'm gonna give each of you about two minutes, introduce yourself, talk about your company, and extol the virtues say anything you want about your platform. How often does a journalist give you that opportunity? Dave, you’re on the clock go?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDave O’Flanagan:\u003c/strong\u003e Thank you. So great to be here. And thanks for having me. My name is Dave O’Flanagan. I'm the chief product officer in Sitecore. I joined almost two years ago and when Sitecore acquired my business I was the CEO and co-founder of a business called Boxever. We provided enterprise CDP and personalization capabilities to large enterprises globally. So that was the start of a really exciting Sitecore transformation that we've been on over the last two years.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost people would know Sitecore. We have a long and storied history in the DXP space. But over the last few years, we made a number of acquisitions to jumpstart or accelerate our path to the cloud. And so today, we've got the only fully composable SAS DXP in the market, where we've got end-to-end capabilities across content, experience and commerce.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe believe that the monolithic approach to the DXP has served the market really well over the over the past decade. But we're really, really passionate about the fact that we've unbundled that capability now, and provided as a composable platform where it offers customers a huge amount of choice in terms of the products they want to implement and how they want to implement them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when customers are ready just to implement CMS, they can do that when they want to expand for capabilities in data or personalization or commerce, they can avail of them from us or other vendors, depending on what their strategy is going forward. So we're really excited about the composable DXP and the choice and capabilities that it offers to customers globally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eWow, great job, Dave. Kept it under two minutes. Didn't have to ding you there. Great job. All right, up next, Deane from Optimizely. What do you got?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeane Barker:\u003c/strong\u003e Hey, everybody. My name is Deane Barker. I am the Global Director of Content Management at Optimizely. Optimizely, of course, is the company that was previously Episerver. We've been a player in the CMS and DXP space for probably 20 years. Recently, much like Sitecore, we've made several acquisitions in the space. We just expanded into content marketing platforms, we acquired a company called Welcome software last year, we now have a full featured a CMP platform to complement our CMS platform. We also have the entire full range of DXP options. We have a CDP content recommendations tool, we have a full ecommerce suite, we have a full stack of offerings. So that's our end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, sweet Deane, and I think you just set the record for most acronyms given in a one minute span on a podcast.

And then CMP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeane:\u003c/strong\u003e CMP is a content marketing platform. This is the system where you do your content collaboration and your editorial scheduling. It's everything you do prior to opening up your CMS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Lovely, lovely. Alright, so let's get into a little bit from Nick. So, Nick, Contentstack, you're on the clock, two minutes, what do you got?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Barron:\u003c/strong\u003e It's wonderful to be here, guys. My name's Nick Barron. I'm the senior director of architecture here at Contentstack and have been in and out of the CMS game for the better part of the last two decades.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a little bit about Contentstack. We started 10 years ago, really pioneering the headless CMS space. And today, the content experience platform as a category leader, empowering marketers and developers to deliver content experiences that are faster, easier and built out on their own terms.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. So we really helped set the industry agenda and standard for opening composable technology that's microservices based API-first cloud, native SAS and headless. And a big part of that is also giving people kind of the choice over which cloud provider they're going to be hosting on the content experience platform really addresses head on the challenges that both an enterprise business and technical users face when creating digital experiences, right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo providing rich, meaningful and powerful content creation experiences for the marketer and the editor, as well as allowing the technologists the freedom and flexibility to really leverage any of the cutting edge and and leading technologies that are out there today. I mean, really, with the launch of our recent automation hub, combined with the one click marketplace, it's really never been easier for brands to actually compose up the DXP of their dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca title=\"The Benefits — and Challenges — of Composable Digital Experience Platforms\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/the-benefits-and-challenges-of-composable-digital-experience-platforms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eThe Benefits — and Challenges — of Composable Digital Experience Platforms\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDXP Use Cases and Customer Needs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Great. All right, gentlemen, thank you for that. Now, we got that out of the way, we got the promos out of the way, the elevator pitch. Now we're going to talk about what's going on in the ground. What are you hearing from customers, industry trends, things you hear and advisory boards conferences? Looking forward to it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo let's go to topic one. Let's like talk about DXP use cases to start off. So we'd love to hear about some of those prevalent use cases for DXPs. How are organizations using this technology? How are they integrating this technology into the larger marketing technology stack? We know that's a huge challenge. And you know, what originally has brought these teams into market for a DXP? Like, what are they? What kind of problems do they come to you with? Let's go with Nick on that one. Since you went last first time around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's interesting coming up this with a bit of a different perspective, right. So being a composable first platform and headless technology provider, you've really kind of been watching the market interest in this idea of a DXP fluctuate over the last three, five years, there's a subset of the market that are really true builders, and they don't really want any more digital experience suites, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe're looking to be sort of tied down to one kind of solution for different areas of their business. And we're really seeing this need for these different teams to be able to build and compose up what they need, leveraging other MACH technologies, right, the microservices API, first cloud, native, headless, etc., really, to compile that into one kind of perfect DXP. From our perspective, that's really the big use case that we see is this need to communicate in real time across a variety of channels and touchpoints.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd really following along as the end users and customers are, are sort of transient as they're going around, right? And all of this really kind of just boils back to the the three key things, right? We want to make money, they want to save money, or they want to increase their customer loyalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Nice indeed, how about the use case for Optimizely, too, you know, how are these customers coming to you in the first place? So what's their big need?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeane:\u003c/strong\u003e You know, I feel like it's hard to talk about a use case for DXP because DXP can be all encompassing. Our system is composable, within our own product suite. So we have customers that come in looking for simply a CMS, we have a lot of customers come in and just looking for a CMP.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd and then the other end, we have customers that we engage with that are looking for content recommendations, or a CDP, but they eventually expand to use more of the suite. In all these pieces really work together and if you just have one of them, you're sort of missing the point. There are absolutely some organizations that just want to manage content for their website. That was our bread and butter for many, many years. We certainly welcome those customers in, but it's not long before they kind of saturate the utility of just managing the content for their website. And they want to take that next step. They want to optimize the delivery, they want to do experimentation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they want to do A/B testing, they want to kind of expand their experience footprint, beyond just generating content, I always say they want to move through the publish button, right? A lot of what happens is you hit “publish” to kind of throw content over the wall. And that's how we did it for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now we have companies who want to move through the publish button, and they want to be in that experience with their customer while they're consuming that content. They want to be able to optimize that content, which is where we sell a lot of our kind of later stage in the experience, tools, recommendations CDP's experimentations. So become sort of a land and expand. There's a lot of ways into our suite in terms of use case. But before long, we have our customers expanding to use more and more parts of the suite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, and I think Deane said something that really struck a chord because we're hearing a lot of you know, hey, “web content management” is an outdated term. You know, many people are saying like “web CMS,” like people were saying, Why did you say “web CMS” in that article on CMSWire? It's just CMS. Now it's everything?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, we do it because it's kind of it gets confused with CMS, Medicare, Medicaid. That's kind of why we do it. But switching to Dave, from Sitecore, are you seeing that use case really expand? I mean, of course, some people have to have those core website, content management systems. I mean, I know that's my life day to day. But you've seen that true expansion, where the use cases they're wanting more out of the DXP than just that website performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDave:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Yeah, and you know what we've what we've got is a huge number of use cases deployed in the field. And everything from I guess where Sitecore started with some basic web content management. But we look at General Mills, a customer and they scale across all of their brands to deploy an enormous instance of Sitecore, that manages a huge number of content authors to be able to connect the dots across all of these brands and author and collaborate to deliver on the business objectives in a tool that makes sense for their business.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I think we see the expansion of that. It's really interesting. The DXP expansion was one of the reasons we moved to composable and kind of decomposed our core portfolio was that certain customers would have a large investment in \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/cmswire-contributor-qa-with-jon-russo-lead-vs-contact-based-models-in-salesforce/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Salesforce\"\u003eSalesforce\u003c/a\u003e, for instance. And if they had that, they might want to use Salesforce CDP or personalization for Salesforce. And we wanted to make sure that, you know, our platform was open enough to allow them to leverage the investments that they'd already made and build the stack that they needed to build. So some of our customers, they want to expand with Sitecore.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they leverage our personalization capabilities and CDP and commerce capabilities, and really go to kind of stretch the digital experience, not just in the digital world, which is, you know, web mobile, and kiosks and and those types of things. But also, even in the physical world where we can connect the dots in the contact center, and for some of our, our airline customers, even in the airplane, and the experience that's delivered digitally is replicated physically and all connected through our CDP and personalization.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we're seeing some really interesting, exciting use cases and extensions of what would traditionally be the digital experience platform. But one one big trend, I guess we're seeing in the market is this desire and ability to be more flexible and agile with your architecture, and allow customers to plug and play different products, not just from within the Sitecore stack, but also other stacks to achieve the business objectives that they might have depending on the needs and wants from a particular vendor. So it's a really interesting and fluid space. I think at the moment in the DXP world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e Deane, you had mentioned that it's difficult to nail down a use case. Could you offer like one of the more common use cases your organization sees?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeane:\u003c/strong\u003e So we do full stack marketing, I mean, marketing teams, everything from ideating, content, planning content, collaborating on content and publishing that content to a channel and then optimizing that content after it's been published. So really full spectrum teams.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have traditionally been web-centric. But that has changed just dramatically with the market recently. We do a lot of business with headless customers. It's funny, you mentioned before the phrase web content management, my first book, I wrote the O'Reilly animal book, which was entitled “Web Content management.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I missed the headless trend in that book by about six months. And so I actually have my first book is called “Web Content Management,” which is kind of ironic now because we have so many customers repurposing their content into other things: mobile apps, and display advertising and print. And we have become a generalized content management platform with tools that optimize for specific channels, the web just being one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eThank you. I'll ask the same question for Nick and Dave, Nick, give us one super common use case like this is something a lot of organizations are doing with your software?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I think the big one really is to kind of pile on to the previous answer is leveraging the omnichannel capabilities of delivering content across a variety of channels and touchpoints. We see that as one of the key drivers that really get somebody to lean into the \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/composable-the-marketers-perspective-and-roadmap/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"composable\"\u003ecomposable\u003c/a\u003e approach, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause you can then take that content, assets, images, etc. You can take all of this goodness from a digital perspective. And you can bring it to wherever the end user is. And I think that's the big difference right from the WCMS days of yore right is that we've moved into this channel of choice mentality and the transient user expects to be able to have a consistent conversation, wherever they are, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeographically, physically, or emotionally, right, whatever device they happen to be on at that moment. That's where it's important for the brand to be able to deliver that consistent messaging, whether that's going to be at a gas station pump or in you know, an in game experience for online video games. It's the way in which brands are now able to communicate almost in real time across all of these different endpoints really allows us to lean into the omnichannel story on a daily basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, the technologies are there, but you hope they can actually execute it too, right? You see examples of disconnection with experiences like the cell phone store doesn't remember the conversation you had on Twitter, that kind of thing. So I think that's when you have the customer experience issues that come into play, and the digital teams kind of executing on what the software can deliver. We see that a lot. Dave, how about you? Is there one super common overwhelming use case for Sitecore?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDave:\u003c/strong\u003e I think the super common one is as honestly, data driven, personalized web and mobile experiences, that is the bread and butter of DXP. But we've got some really interesting use cases, our intranet and many of our customers’ intranets are powered by Sitecore DXP software, and it's in partnership with a company called DoZen and which is really cool.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it's looking at the employee experience. We just announced a partnership with Microsoft. And we have a demo that we've demoed at CES recently to show the DXP in the metaverse, so hopefully skeptical about about the metaverse and the future. But it was a cool demo where you walk into a virtual showroom. And the virtual showroom was powered by our DXP software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you can start to look at the Triumph motorcycle in 3D. And that is a 2D version as well. And all of the just like on the on the web or mobile, we had interaction data. We were able to transact. So you could purchase that with our commerce platform in the metaverse. You could talk to an agent there as well. So I think we're seeing the experience being stretched into all manner of new mediums, which is pretty exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca title=\"What's Your Definition of a Digital Experience Platform?\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/whats-your-definition-of-a-digital-experience-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eWhat's Your Definition of a Digital Experience Platform?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDXP Personas: Who Owns These Tools? \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Excellent. All right, like topic two, folks, let's move on to DXP personas, I'm really, really curious. We do so much persona work, and CMSWire is trying to figure out who we're talking to, what we're writing about, and who cares about what. So in the DXP world, who's claiming ownership of these tools, you know, you always wonder, right? Is it an IT thing? Is it a marketing thing? Who is that common customer that the top product people in your company would deal with most often? Let's start with Deane on that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeane:\u003c/strong\u003e So online marketers for sure, although we are seeing the market shift a bit. Headless has kind of gotten more of a developer persona in, we've always catered to developers who have a strong developer community, but you're seeing more and more people are coming in looking for headless and being driven by their IT department. A lot of headless CMS is not all but a lot of them are really developer plays developer-centric plays.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we're seeing quite a bit of influence there. But traditionally, the online marketer has been our core customer that and a content web manager, especially with our foray into CMP. We're working with a lot of very, very content-centric teams. So these are people that are planning and generating the content, publishing the content and managing the marketing experience after publication.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e So with that beat director level and above in marketing and head of it, CIO kind of people.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeane: \u003c/strong\u003eProbably one level below that Director of Marketing, not someone we would generally see interact directly with the system, except maybe on a dashboard and reporting basis. These are the actual people on the frontlines in the trenches doing the actual campaign work.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e And Dave at Sitecore, let's talk about the who of Sitecore, who's the person you're talking to the most?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDave:\u003c/strong\u003e I would say it's almost split down the middle between business and builder. You know, I think Sitecore generally sells in at a quite a senior level in big organizations. But the users of the platform are the marketers and the practitioners.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, though, I certainly see a huge groundswell of change around the types of people who want to evaluate the products. And there's definitely I think, with the advent of headless and MACH, it definitely feels like the technical side of the business is coming, looking for infrastructure and strategic architectures, to be able to deliver against the business needs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo for us, I think any sales process or even any engagement with a customer, we got to be helping the customer, achieve their business goals in the tools and be able to create campaigns and content and deliver that. But very often, you know, we're in there alongside some of the technical folks as well helping them integrate the platform into their architecture and get more value out of the products that they've acquired.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it's, it's a mix, we have a concept called the Digital Dream Team at Sitecore is a senior marketing leader and the practitioner, and then it's a senior digital or technology leader, and their developer. And, you know, they're the kind of four personas or people that we try to cater for with with our products on proposition.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Good story idea there, Rich, right? Who's your digital Dream Team? Who needs to be on that? And a lot of smaller companies, I would imagine it's a party of one. Oh, who's the digital that guy? Of course he does. Nick will give you an opportunity to talk about what's going on at Contentstack for the person or the persons you're talking to the most over there with the software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick:\u003c/strong\u003e As we fit in into the enterprise space as well, right? We find ourselves hitting that director and up kind of level and kind of split down the middle as well, right? You either have these marketing teams who were driving these powerful initiatives to sort of streamline their workflows and their process side of things, right to just get things done faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then we also have these deep architecture conversations and relationships that build up where, when you're composing your own DXP, with a variety of composable platforms and tools, those architectural decisions that that as we mentioned earlier, we start with the CMS right become wildly important.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we see this balance between those two teams. And there's a really interesting emergence of a third persona that's gaining more and more traction, and lots of these innovation teams that have started popping up at your fortune 5000 companies that are tasked with going out and kind of building the architecture of the future in sort of a rapid POC, kind of super quick way of doing it, and getting a lot of that fun experimentation done.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we see traction across all of those being one of the few headless CMS platforms, right, that's really based more on the end user experience. Right. So who's actually in the platform and being less of a developer first organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca title=\"Why Monolithic Digital Experience Platforms Still Trump Composable\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/why-monolithic-digital-experience-platforms-still-trump-composable/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eWhy Monolithic Digital Experience Platforms Still Trump Composable\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTop DXP Challenges for Marketers: Integration and Complexity\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eExcellent. And with all that, now, knowing the use cases that personas, let's talk about some of the challenges, right, some of the huge challenges that these teams are coming to because you're talking to them, you're hearing from them directly. Nick will just continue on with you or let you go first, you went last last time? And what would be top of mind significant challenge they're facing right now, as we record this in early 2023.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I think the and I always like to think of these things as opportunities, right? Not challenges, because every problem is just a solution in waiting, I can tell that's my my nerd background kind of breaking through there a little bit. But um, I think the the biggest challenges really are breaking down the walls between different regions, LOBs different organizational units within these massive organizations and helping them streamline the processes that they have, right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when we look at it, it's this combination of the the human process needs to be put into flux, the technology that powers all of that, obviously, is super critical to that. All of that is what really allows for the brand to do more with less budget or with fewer people and do that at a global scale.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I think really, the challenge that most brands are facing is leveraging the technological investments that they're making, or have already made in doing that at scale across these massive organizations, it's just really hard to try to get all of these different people on the same page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich: \u003c/strong\u003eI mean, you think about the people who these tools are getting rolled out to, and the onslaught of digital tools and platforms that they have to log in every day. I mean, it's really not surprising that that is a huge challenge. I mean, Dom and I've talked about it on the show before we use something like 30 or 40 platforms every day. So yeah, I think that's a very common challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Anything resonate in that statement from Nick, are you hearing different things from Optimizely?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeane:\u003c/strong\u003e No, I absolutely concur with Nick. I mean, the biggest problem that marketing teams have now is that they just have so many options for how to address their customers and how to improve the experience, that there's just almost too many for them to keep track of. And as a vendor, what's our job is to make it as approachable as possible, reduce as much complexity as possible. But there's a base floor of complexity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, things that people are doing now are just complex from a logical domain level standpoint. And so, as a vendor, we try very hard to make it straightforward. What we are finding, and this may be a point of contention among the panelists, but the drive toward composability is introducing quite a few integration issues.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, if you compose a suite out of multiple different vendors, you have to get them all working together, which we have seen as a problem with some of the people that are coming to us for solutions to that problem. But that is just a symptom of the larger trend, that there are so many different ways now to address the experience that a marketing team has to cover so many different bases. And I would say that's the biggest challenge in facing digital marketing today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e Analysis paralysis. So many options out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e That's too bad, Rich, I really wanted Deane to just cut down everything Nick said and just get in to a big vendor fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeane:\u003c/strong\u003e No, sorry, Nick was spot on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eOh man, Nick was spot on, man, they're gonna use that as a promotion. Now Optimizely said Contentstack is is spot on. But Dave, you weigh in, you disagree with someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDave: \u003c/strong\u003eI actually kind of agree with the guys as well. This is like I do think that and it's something in Sitecore. We've been thinking a lot about right. So we've been really on a big journey of transformation. And when we released our composable DXP we wanted to offer going to kind of solve two problems. We wanted to solve for the customer who wanted to go more granular and was happy maybe accepting a little bit more complexity but having the agility of multiple vendors maybe solving specific things that they needed in their stack.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if customers want to go all in on Sitecore, we provide an integrated suite that has a unified editing interface, a unified experience management interface, analytics, CDP, all of that data. And capability is available through a single pane of glass. And I think that over time, customers are going to recompose some of the DXP. But you know, what that looks like is still TBD.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we're trying to flex and provide customers choice. But in the end, you know, what we've seen from some customers is that the integration overhead of going pure composable is a significant challenge that isn't to be underestimated, because it's easy, run the POC, you know, it's easy, stand something up and get the site up. But then when you want to scale that across a few hundred, a few thousand content authors with data going in multiple geographies, and it becomes a very complex ecosystem that, you know, the TCP over time needs to be considered.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it's this balancing, I think, whether everything gets re bundled into a new monolith, I don't think so. But I do think the flexibility offered by, you know, a pre integrated capability is something that is certainly valued by a lot of customers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it's, the market will decide, you know, we used to call composable, best of breed. I think today, it's a little bit different. But over time, I think customers are really looking for the ability to be more productive with the capabilities that they procure, whether that's from a single vendor or multi vendor. And that's on all of us to try solve that problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca title=\"Selecting a Digital Experience Platform?

So I'll just pose this one for Nick. I mean, we've seen we've seen in our 2023, State of the Digital Customer Experience report by CMSWire, we've seen a substantial number of organizations who are looking towards a headless or a composable solution. So Nick, where do you come in on this and your customers in terms of that move to composable that move to headless? Wanting something like that? And kind of contrasting that with the traditional DXP? Like, what's the use case there? What's your thoughts on headless?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, that's pretty core to my being at the moment, right? So being a composable, first platform, we of course, recognize all of these kinds of complexities and the different approaches that organizations need to take and that it can lead to this analysis, paralysis of you know, what other solutions do we pull into the, you know, the old moniker of best in breed, right? How do you navigate that path? And how do you build something and sustain? Right, that's the key there.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I think that's what what Dave was hitting on is have these things, especially with the TCO being applied, it can get cumbersome over time. And that's why you're seeing a lot of platforms like Contentstack and others rollout. These complex marketplaces full of, you know, pre-integrated and supported integrations, right are things like automation hubs to really automate a lot of the automatable business workflow process that can slow people down, when you have those 40 some odd different applications you were talking about that a marketer asked us throughout their day. If we can help streamline those problems, right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that's what we kind of do on a day to day, that's really where we start to see success, and we see adoption, and then we see the friction just get reduced, right as these DXPs, whether it's, you know, starting with something that's pre-composed or composing it yourself, right, the nice thing with them is they all get more complex over time. So bringing a strategy from kind of day zero to the table of how are we going to do that? How are we going to maintain that? And how are we going to manage that moving forward? Really seems to help solve that worry in that future stress, you know, really trying to future proof as best you can a composable solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated Article:\u0026nbsp;\u003ca title=\"25 Best Free or Premium Headless Content Management Systems (CMS)\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/web-cms/13-headless-cmss-to-put-on-your-radar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e25 Best Free or Premium Headless Content Management Systems (CMS)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHave CMS Vendors Have Always Been Composable?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich: \u003c/strong\u003eThank you. I did have a quick follow up for Dave, I just was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on what you see as the differences between composable and best of breed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDave: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I think they're one and the same. To be honest, I think it's the new new thing. When we were implementing our CDP and personalization solution in organizations, you know, we were part of a stack we integrated with Sitecore, Adobe optimize the whoever else was in the stack, we implemented but we were very much part of a best of breed strategy where customers wanted to go with individual specialist vendors like us versus other vendors versus all in with a suite play.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so there's kind of two things. So in composable, sometimes in a best of breed Martech stack, it's very much big, big pieces of software that live alongside each other. I think when we talk about composable DXP, I think it's a little bit more granular is content recommendations, composable. From one vendor or another, it's the presentation there can be composable, with one vendor or another. And I think you know, it's certainly something that's been on my mind since I joined Sitecore trying to understand how we can best play there.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one of the things we've been really excited about over the last kind of six months or so it was, you know, we released a net new complete build from the ground up headless CMS, because we believe that there's absolutely a need in the market for customers who want to build like that. And that's in addition to our kind of core CMS platform that people would know that we've reached. We transition to the cloud.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I do think that customers want to build in different ways and different customers have different strategies and composability in the DXP space is probably more focused on decomposing or unbundling what was traditionally part of the kind of website capability. The DXP was the CMS for some data management, put some personalization, maybe workflow and identity services.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now what we're seeing is identity services go to an old zero or Gigya. You know, maybe personalization goes to somebody else. And I think that's perfectly OK. But I think you've got to know that if you do go down that route, that true multivendor composable route, there's a lot of products you got to log into on a daily basis to get your job done. That's something that I think we're gonna see solved in the DXP space over the next while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd Dean, why don't you weigh in on this on this matter, too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeane:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I gotta say, I get a little frustrated, sometimes with vendors, laying claim to the mantle of composability. Composability is a big buzzword right now in the industry. But I don't know that a time that my company in particular other companies wherever not composable, Composability depends on how you break the stack down. But our system, I mean, our CMS system, which would kind of our core root system, always worked with other platforms, when we we just acquired a CDP 18 months ago, but it's not like people weren't using CDPs, with our platform before, they were using all manner of different CDP's. They're using all manner of different CMPs all manner of different content recommendation tools. It's a pejorative term now to call a vendor, a monolithic vendor. I always think that's very unfair. I mean, if you look at Optimizely suite, and I'm gonna say probably Sitecore suite as well, those tools can be mixed and matched.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have customers using our product, our products, any manner of our different combination of our products, with all sorts of different other products. And so the kind of label of composability versus monolithic, frustrates me a little bit because I think it can be used disingenuously?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe true meaning of 'composability' in DXPs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I'm gonna have to play Chris Wallace here the presidential debate and ask Dave for a follow up to that response. He did poke Sitecore in that one. So, Dave, you get a response to what Dean just said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDave:\u003c/strong\u003e I think we've acknowledged that the monolithic architecture in Sitecore has served its purpose. And for sure, partners can customize it really, really well to achieve goals and kind of decompose it. But the more it's customized, the harder it is to upgrade. And I think composability does certainly lend itself to atomic units that are MACH. So they're API first, they're updated or configured via configuration rather than code based customization, which means that it can be more flexibly managed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I'll give you a good example of what we're doing in Sitecore. In terms of composability granularity, our front end authoring environment that we've just added. So we just released two big CMS products. One is our new headless CMS. The second was exempt cloud. So we repurposed and re architect our core content management system to be fully SaaS and cloud native. But as part of that journey, we developed a whole new front end authoring environment. So everything site management, page authoring, and component based development, but that authoring environment works with any CMS.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we can connect to Optimizely the, if the API's are there, we can connect to content stuff that the API's are there. And for us, I think that's a granularity in terms of composability that you wouldn't have traditionally seen in a DXP. So maybe that's an example of where, you know, CDPs, for sure, are a bigger, chunkier product that will integrate with different products alongside CMS or something else.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we're going a little bit more granular to offer a customer's choice where, you know, maybe there are different ways to store manage content in their ecosystem. And we want to provide customers the ability to kind of create and orchestrate experiences in our platform, even if some of the content is stored in other databases and other systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeane:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so I'll concede that Dave, that goes back to the point that I made earlier that whether or not you're monolithic, or composable, just depends on how granular you break the stack down. And what you're saying. There's the you're breaking the CMS stack down into like editing environment, repository and delivery, which is absolutely a fair point. So if you do break that kind of CMS stack down, then sure you can introduce a new level of composability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, the biggest breakdown we're seeing in the CMS stack, clearly over the last five to 10 years has been the separation of management from delivery. Yeah, but we always look at headless I mean, our saying ar Optimizely is that headless isn't a product, it's a feature. It's a feature of a generalized content management experience. I mean, we even break that down, meaning we have customers that don't use our templating subsystem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;We have a very, very clean isolatable double system of templating and server side rendering code. We have customers that don't use it. They use our system with React, we just provide that option. So I still bristle a little bit at the monolithic versus composable dichotomy. I feel like its usage is a bit disingenuous in many cases.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e All right? Well, I'm gonna bring in Nick on this mini debate here because you know, Nick content stack has composable written all over its marketing. So I'd like you to have a response to what Dean said about, you know, taking issue with the composability label.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and I mean, coming from the kind of legacy CMS history, right, that's where I kind of cut my teeth in the industry. I think a lot of that monolithic moniker right really applies less about the ease of integration and composing and, you know, having these extensibility points pre baked into the platform.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I think a lot of it also comes into play with what is coming as a part of that precomposed solution that isn't being leveraged. And I'm trying to poke at anybody here, right, because I know that everybody's kind of decomposing that construct, right, where you're now given a lot more choice over, you know, which personalization, I think personalization is a great illustrative point for composability. Because the different personalization vendors work in wildly different ways. They all serve incredibly distinct in different use cases from each other. And being able to have a platform that can compose with those, the front end and the actual digital experience, regardless of channel that somebody needs to experience, I think that's the power of composable, right is being able to make those choices that serve whatever the need of your individual business is, because pre composing a bunch of that together fits a pretty broad range of brands and organizations. But it doesn't necessarily cater to folks who have, you know, really niche use cases.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd again, I mean, even even back in the day, when I was managing Windows 98 servers, right, you could, you could compose those old dotnet platforms into each other, just by, you know, modifying the code. So I think the point is valid, right, you can really compose up any solution given enough time and resources. But when we think about a composable first platform, it really becomes the core sort of the hub and the Hub and Spoke approach, where all of those extension points are there, they're easy to use, I think it was, Dave made the point of configuration over customization, right, I should be able to go in and change things in an interface, and not have to call the developer up every time, I want to have a different system impact in a different way.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. So I think a big part of composable, or at least what we're seeing now is extending that capability, that core composing technology to users who don't have a programming degree or computer science degree, and instead want to go and pick modules out of a publicly available repository from a variety of vendors. And for that purpose at that moment in time be able to execute with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeane:\u003c/strong\u003e Alright, as long as we're talking about composability interoperability, I just want to ask how many people on the call have heard about this Osiris Alliance and their CDIS protocol? Okay, so mark is great, the MACH Alliance is great, but the MACH is about in business and philosophy, there's a new organization called the Osiris Alliance instead of OsirisAlliance.org. And they're actually promoting a protocol that they're calling CDIS — composable data interchange standards. And this is the protocol that they hope will become the glue the language between all of our different content technology tools. And so I think when we talk about composability, we always talk about interoperability, and how to get things working together. But there really are no kind of boots on the ground trying to solve that problem for the industry as a whole. I think this is the first time I've seen that they are pushing an actual language and an actual protocol that they're going to attempt to solve this problem of intercommunication between content technology tools. So if that interests you is worth checking out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Impact of Generative AI on Digital Experiences in 2023\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Deane Barker with another story idea for CMSWire. All right, we do need to wrap up, what a discussion, it's been healthy debate. Good case studies from what you guys have seen in the industry from customers. Thank you very much. Let's wrap up with one question. And of course, we cannot talk about anything digital, unless we bring up \u003ca title=\"ChatGPT\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/chatgpt-what-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eChatGPT\u003c/a\u003e. So here we go. And by the way, I'm going to put into chat GPT, who won the composability debate, and I'm gonna put this transcript right in there. And I'm gonna give you guys the results. You're on the hook.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut let's seriously talk sum it up succinctly with all that's going on with the CRAZY evolution of AI in the last three or four months, and 2022 beginning of 2023. You know, how does that impact the users of your software? How do you see these advancements, integrating with your software, if at all? What are going to be the use cases anything that's on your mind regarding ChatGPT generative AI and what major changes we're going to see coming down the road with DXPs. We'll go with Nick on this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick:\u003c/strong\u003e Sure. I think it's wild. It's fun. It's neat. It's interesting. And I want to preface any answer with I feel like we've been asking the same question of AI for the last five or six years, and I feel like my answer has always been, oh, man, I can't wait to see what happens in a year or two, because that's where we're gonna have these big breakthroughs. And it kind of feels like we've hit that inflection point with some of this content and human readable information that's being generated, right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I think we're one step away from where the real exciting part is, of having story generation become a thing, having some level of a historical record being able to be created and maintained through some level of autonomy. And I think that's really neat. Obviously, there's scary guardrails and things like that, that need to be applied and approached correctly from an ethical perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;But yeah, I mean, we're constantly looking into innovations using some of these cutting edge technologies. And I really think it's going to be a big boon to our industries, right? I mean, if we think about if we cut all of our DXPs, and CMSs down to the core, it's technology that allows people to tell stories to other people. And by leveraging something that makes that easier and enriches it and exposes different cultures in different languages and just starts cutting down some barriers. I think that's, that's a really exciting future that we all have to look forward to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eDave, what's on the radar for \u003ca title=\"generative AI\" href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/generative-ai-opportunities-and-challenges-for-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003egenerative AI\u003c/a\u003e for Sitecore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDave: \u003c/strong\u003eIt really offers amazing opportunities to all vendors like us, you know, I think, for a long time, that level of AI was probably unreachable, just requiring a huge amount of investment in terms of people and compute. And now it's available via an API.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo like, we've seen this, this is just a proliferation of startups like well, one and two person startups that are all doing things like email, subject generation, or blog generation, or content, images, image generation. And all of these things are, they're just amazing to see how much has happened in such a short period of time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I think we didn't need something to replace the Web 3 and NFT hype. So that's kind of jumped in to fill the gap. But I think for us, you know, when you think about marketing efficiency, and the ability for a marketer to sit down, and create content that's SEO optimized that can connect with the audience that he or she is trying to speak to. I think this offers just crazy opportunities to get things done quicker and faster. And so I really think that this type of capability is going to be a core feature of most DXPs. Very, very soon, it'll just be expected that you can auto optimize autogenerate create content really, really quickly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do hope, though, that we don't end up with lots and lots of generic spam blogs and imagery, and that we can still create space and time for creative marketing. And maybe this is the opportunity to take some of the mundane stuff off their table so that they can focus on some of the more exciting inspirational marketing that really connects with end consumers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e I was saying much the same thing you guys are saying recently on CMSWire, we published an article on how marketing teams can use ChatGPT to do things like product descriptions, and a lot of the mundane things that are just time sucks for people in the office every day.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, how about transcribe this 9,000 word podcast, into like five takeaways. I mean, that's something that human Dom Nicastro took, you know, a full workday to do. And ChatGPT does it in about three-to-five seconds.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo let's finish up with Deane giving you the chance to talk about generative AI and potential integrations with Optimizely. I mean, we get to see the day where we say, ChatGPT, write a blog post in Optimizely for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeane:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I mean, it's not potential, we've actually implemented it twice. It's an open beta now. In our CMP platform, our content marketing platform, you have two options for generative AI, we use stable diffusion for images generation. So you can add an image to some content, just type of prompt and it'll give you four images you can pick from, you pick your dimensions and aspect ratio, but it'll give you four to pick from, if you don't like them, you can just regenerate four more and then choose the one you want insert that. And then the other one that we do is smart content.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo if you're writing a document and you're stuck on something, you can bring up a dialogue and enter a prompt and it will prompt you with five or six different snippets of what you're trying to say we limit it to 75 words, we don't intend for you to write entire blog posts with that it's just to get you past a sticking point, here's a paragraph or something. But we have two instances running in open beta now that will make general availability probably in the first half of this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich: \u003c/strong\u003eJust a quick question, a follow up on that. I think everybody here is seeing the news around copyright issues, stable diffusion, these images that are be creating, how has your organization had to deal with that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDave:\u003c/strong\u003e Way, way above my paygrade but I absolutely tell you it is discussed. We are waiting to see how that legal landscape plays out. So yeah, very much under discussion, something very much on our radar, but as for our specific legal plans, they're absolutely out of my depth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich:\u003c/strong\u003e Thank you. There's a lot to think through and yeah, it's gonna have an impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDom:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, we've had A healthy discussion here long discussion. So we're going to wrap it up. Thank you guys for joining us. I can't thank you enough. It's funny, Rich, you know, we usually say, well, the vendors, you know, you want to be careful, they might do a lot of promotions and stuff and all that. So we don't really want.
