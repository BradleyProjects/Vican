Hey Mike,
All the known autoresponder/newsletter tools (Aweber, GetResponse, Mailchimp, ...) let you split test your subject lines and message content.
I don&#039;t have in-depth experience with InfusionSoft but sounds like it&#039;s most powerful email features are sending behavioral emails and personalized messages.
Most landing page creation software also has split testing capability built in (LeadPages, Unbounce) but their tracking and reporting is quite limited.
My #1 split testing tool is  Optimizely. It&#039;s free for up to 50k visitors and works on any site.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the podcast (especially because it&#039;s about Lead Ads ;)).
Besides SyncSumo there are other platforms available as well for Lead Ads (such at https://driftrock.com &#038; https://connectleads.io).
Keep up the good work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly :)
Thanks for everything.
I have a question... I know that u said that we should optimize cold campaign for click.
But now facebook is changed.
I see a new voice &quot;Impression&quot; . The difference now between them is the cost.
Website click is CPC (min. budget 5$)
Impression is CPM (min budget 1$)
I read a guideline of facebook that said that old websiste click system had CPM system.
What I should do? could choose &quot;Impression&quot; ???]]></description>
