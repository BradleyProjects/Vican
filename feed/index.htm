<p>So let&#8217;s take a deep dive into each one of them and help you become more strategic about how best to capitalize on modern technologies!</p>



<h2>12 Top Digital Marketing Trends</h2>



<p>Here is a list of the top digital marketing trends with&nbsp; detailed insights you need to pay attention to in 2023:</p>



<h3>1. Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning</h3>



<p>The use of AI and machine learning is probably the most popular trend, which is gaining traction in digital marketing at the moment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165775" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>With algorithms controlling what social media posts you engage with, which search results surface, and even determining the ads that appear before your eyes, AI-driven marketing ensures a tailored experience for customers everywhere.</p>



<p>This amazing technology can help organizations optimize their marketing campaigns with predictive analytics and advanced data insights.</p>



<p>Plus, AI can also be used to automate mundane tasks such as content curation, customer segmentation, &amp; personalization to facilitate better engagement with customers.</p>



<p>AI content creation tools such as <a href="https://jasper.ai?utm_source=partner&amp;fpr=lauren41" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jasper</a>, ChatGPT, and Midjourney are already revolutionizing how digital marketers create written content and images at 10x speed.</p>



<p>This is definitely going to be one of the hottest trends in advertising in the coming years.</p>



<h3>2. Immersive Experiences</h3>



<p>Immersive experiences are becoming an increasingly important part of digital marketing these days as they enable customers to interact with a brand on a more personal level.</p>



<p>Customers today don&#8217;t just want to browse through products. Instead, they look for an emotionally engaging experience that adds to their overall satisfaction.</p>



<p>Some of the best tools to offer immersive experiences are:</p>



<p><strong>Virtual Reality</strong> &#8211; VR helps customers immerse themselves in a virtual environment and see what it would be like if the product was bought.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-vertically-aligned-center has-pale-ocean-gradient-background has-background" style="grid-template-columns:25% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SocialMedia-300x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-155571 size-thumbnail" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SocialMedia-300x300.png 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SocialMedia-300x300-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-group" style="padding-top:2em;padding-right:2em;padding-bottom:2em;padding-left:2em"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">

</div></div>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Augmented Reality</strong> &#8211; AR helps customers to virtually experience the product in their own physical environment.</p>



<p>Using AR and VR, marketers can create interactive video ads and pop-up stores where customers can try and interact with products before buying them.</p>



<p>And this is exactly what happens in the <a href="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/blog/5-changes-to-instagram-shops-that-cannot-be-ignored-lauren-petrullo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">metaverse</a>. It&#8217;s a virtual world where people have digital avatars, which they can use to interact with other people and visual projections of products, play games, participate in virtual events, and buy or sell virtual assets.</p>



<p>This might sound unreal, but it&#8217;s all happening. As a matter of fact, brands like <em>IKEA</em>, <em>Nike</em>, and <em>Amazon</em> are already using AR to offer such virtual product experiences.</p>



<p>Immersive experiences like these create an interactive, real-world-like environment for customers to explore and gain insights about products/services, enhancing the user experience.</p>



<h3>3. Content Marketing</h3>



<p>Content is said to be “king” and definitely one of the most powerful digital marketing channels for engaging customers and driving conversions.</p>



<p>However, besides increasing engagement and conversion, content marketing is essential for another strong reason: brand awareness.</p>



<p>Did you know that it takes an average user 5 to 7 instances of interaction before they can remember a brand?</p>



<p>This is why it&#8217;s important&nbsp; to consistently create high-quality content that resonates with the target audience and helps them get to know your business better.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165776" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-2.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Content marketing should be an integrated part of any digital marketing strategy in order to build brand awareness, generate leads, and increase conversions.</p>



<p>In addition to traditional content such as blog posts, emails, and social media posts, marketers should also consider creating interactive content such as webinars, live product reviews, quizzes, and polls in order to increase engagement.</p>



<p>All of these make for an <a href="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/certifications/content-marketing-mastery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excellent customer experience and build long-term brand loyalty</a>.</p>



<h3>4. Chatbots &amp; Voice Assistants</h3>



<p>Chatbots and voice assistants are gaining prominence as they help companies provide a more personalized experience for customers.</p>



<p>Chatbots use AI-driven algorithms to provide personalized customer service with automated responses, while voice assistants interact with customers in a more natural way.</p>



<p>Both chatbots and voice assistants help organizations save time and money by automating mundane customer service tasks while providing a more personalized experience for customers.</p>



<p>Doing so, they help customers pass through the sales funnel in a personalized and immersive way, which ultimately helps drive more conversions.</p>



<p>This is why these two have become essential tools of conversational marketing in the modern digital marketing world.</p>



<h3>5. Influencer Collaborations</h3>



<p>Every day, you see content creators promoting clothes, accessories, tech gadgets, or any other product. Whether it&#8217;s an Instagram post, Facebook story, or a TikTok or YouTube video, you will come across such collaborations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-6-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165778" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-6-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-6-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-6-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-6-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-6.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>What does it tell you?</p>



<p>It tells you that influencer marketing is an essential part of digital marketing today.</p>



<p>Influencers can help create buzz around a product or service on different social media platforms, attract more people to your website, and drive conversions.</p>



<p>How?</p>



<p>The explanation is simple; customers today are more likely to trust an influencer than a brand when it comes to recommendations.</p>



<p>This is why many brands and organizations have started leveraging influencer collaborations and making them a vital part of their digital marketing efforts.</p>



<p>Besides more awareness, businesses can also use influencer collaborations to get honest reviews from trusted figures in the industry before they launch their product or service.</p>



<h3>6. Live Video/Streaming</h3>



<p>Live streaming is yet another powerful form of digital marketing and a hot trend in the digital advertising world.</p>



<p>Streaming live content allows brands to engage with their customers in real time and build a strong connection with them. Plus, it also helps customers get answers to their queries and encourages more conversations around the product/service.</p>



<p>Brands can stream live content on various social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This can be in the form of product demonstrations, Q&amp;A sessions, webinars, interviews with industry experts, and more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-3-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165779" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-3.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>But why is it recommended?</p>



<p>Because the algorithm of most social media platforms pushes live content to its news feed and ranks it higher than older content.</p>



<p>This means it will be easier for brands to reach their target customers with live content.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s not just all in theory.</p>



<p>Live commerce is a whole new industry that has gained huge traction in China and is slowly spreading to other regions.</p>



<p>In 2023, the total live commerce market in China is projected to cross $700 billion.</p>



<p>Imagine the impact you can have if ecommerce brands add it to their digital marketing activities.</p>



<h3>7. Email Marketing</h3>



<p>There may come a hundred new trends in digital advertising, but email marketing is the &#8220;never-gonna-die&#8221; classic digital strategy.</p>



<p>Even today, in 2023, it remains one of the most effective ways to reach customers and promote products/services.</p>



<p>Why? Because it&#8217;s a more direct marketing tool as compared to other tools like Google ads, sponsored posts in social media feeds, or TV ads.</p>



<p>Emails are highly targeted and personalized messages.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-7-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165780" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-7-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-7-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-7-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-7-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-7.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This is why businesses (especially ecommerce businesses) use email campaigns to build relationships with customers, announce new product launches and upcoming sales, offer content upgrades, and send other personalized messages.</p>



<p>It is a cost-effective way to reach out to existing and potential customers, build long-term relationships, and drive more sales.</p>



<h3>8. Omni-present Social Media Marketing</h3>



<p>No doubt, social media has become an integral part of digital marketing.</p>



<p>However, just a few years ago, only Facebook was the key platform for brands.</p>



<p>But now, many businesses are focusing on developing an omnipresent social media marketing strategy.</p>



<p>This means they now try to be present on every social media platform. From Instagram to Twitter, YouTube, Snapchat, TikTok, and even <a href="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/blog/social/complete-pinterest-marketing-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pinterest</a>, businesses have started creating their presence on all these platforms.</p>



<p>This omnipresence helps brands ensure that their content reaches a wider audience and is visible in multiple places. This increases brand awareness, encourages more customer engagement, and helps increase conversion rates.</p>



<h3>9. Short Form Video Content</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that video content has become one of the most popular forms of digital marketing.</p>



<p>But what&#8217;s different today is the type of videos being created. Users no longer want to watch long videos and instead wish to consume content in short bursts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-4-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165781" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-4-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-4-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-4-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Top-12-Digital-Marketing-Trends-in-2023-You-Should-Know-4.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This is why TikTok rose to fame and became the most popular app in 2019 and 2020.</p>



<p>TikTok&#8217;s popularity moved businesses towards creating short, eye-catching videos for social media marketing. These videos range from product/service demonstrations to funny skits and even customer testimonials.</p>



<p>However, what happened afterward is even more interesting.</p>



<p>After the meteoric rise of TikTok, Facebook and Instagram introduced &#8220;Reels,&#8221; and YouTube launched &#8220;Shorts.&#8221;</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Simply because short videos are effective; they are great for grabbing the attention of viewers, quickly conveying a message, and engaging customers in an interactive way.</p>



<p>So, short video content is a hot digital marketing trend, which is here to stay!</p>



<h3>10. LinkedIn</h3>



<p>This might come as a surprise, but LinkedIn is now one of the most important platforms for marketing teams.</p>



<p>It is no longer a site for job hunting, business to business collaborations, or data collection. In fact, it has become a hub for individuals and businesses to share digital content in the form of short posts, blog posts, images, and videos.</p>



<p>Entrepreneurs, solopreneurs, and business profiles can use the platform to post relevant content and reach out to their target audience, build relationships with potential customers, and generate leads.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s definitely going to be one of the top trends in advertising in the near future.</p>



<h3>11. Voice Search</h3>



<p>With voice search becoming increasingly popular, digital marketers need to factor this in while creating their marketing strategies.</p>



<p>Voice search is, essentially, the process of using voice commands to search for something on the internet.</p>



<p>For example, if you wanted to know about a local restaurant, you would say something like, &#8220;Find me a good restaurant near me,&#8221; and the voice assistant would display the best results based on your query.</p>



<p>This has now become one of the most popular ways to search, and businesses must create strategies that include voice search optimization.</p>



<p>This means optimizing your content, website, and other marketing materials for voice search. This will help you appear higher in the results when someone uses voice search to look for something that your business offers.</p>



<h3>12. Inclusive Marketing</h3>



<p>Finally, there is the concept of inclusive marketing, which is becoming increasingly important for businesses.</p>

<p>Inclusive marketing refers to creating content and campaigns that are sensitive to people of all backgrounds and cultures, regardless of gender, physical ability, sexual orientation, age, or race.</p>



<p>This is important because it allows businesses to create content that resonates with a wider audience and reach out to customers who may have felt excluded in the past.</p>



<p>Furthermore, it helps create an environment where everyone can feel included and accepted, which can be beneficial for businesses in the long run.</p>



<p>So, these are some of the most promising 2023 trends in digital advertising that businesses should look out for.</p>



<p>Remember, these trends will not be the same for all businesses. You should take the time to analyze your own business and create strategies that are tailored to its needs and goals.</p>



<p>Not sure what your business really needs? This <a href="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/certifications/social-media-mastery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media certificate</a> can help bring clarity.</p>

<p>In today&#8217;s digital age, businesses are constantly seeking innovative ways to improve their lead generation strategies. Traditional methods can be time-consuming and may not always yield the desired results. However, with advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), businesses now have the opportunity to enhance their lead generation efforts and drive better outcomes. In this article, we will explore eight key ways to leverage AI to improve lead generation and propel your business forward.</p>



<h2>Personalized Content Recommendations</h2>



<p>AI-powered algorithms have the ability to analyze vast amounts of data to understand user preferences and behaviors. By leveraging AI, businesses can deliver <a href="https://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/The-publishers-guide-to-audience-engagement-reduced-file-size-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personalized content recommendations</a> to potential leads, increasing engagement and conversion rates. </p>



<p>AI algorithms can analyze a lead&#8217;s browsing history, social media activity, and other relevant data points to suggest content that aligns with their interests and needs. This targeted approach ensures that leads receive content that resonates with them, enhancing the overall customer experience and increasing the likelihood of generating quality leads.</p>



<h2>Chatbots for Instant Engagement</h2>



<p>AI-powered chatbots have revolutionized customer engagement by providing instant and personalized interactions. When integrated into lead generation strategies, chatbots can engage with website visitors, answer queries, and gather relevant information. Chatbots can use natural language processing to understand and respond to user inquiries, providing a seamless and efficient user experience. </p>



<p>By automating initial interactions, businesses can capture leads&#8217; contact information and qualify them based on their responses. This not only streamlines the lead generation process but also ensures that leads receive prompt assistance, enhancing their overall experience with your brand.</p>



<h2>Natural Language Processing for Lead Qualification</h2>



<p>AI-powered <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">natural language processing</a> (NLP) techniques can help businesses automate lead qualification processes. NLP algorithms can analyze and extract information from leads&#8217; responses, such as email inquiries or form submissions, to determine their level of interest and qualification.</p>

<h2>Predictive Lead Scoring</h2>



<p>Lead scoring is a critical aspect of <a href="https://www.skylinesocial.com/ai-lead-generation-software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI lead generation</a>, as it helps businesses prioritize and focus their efforts on the most promising leads.

<p></p>



<p>It takes only 0.146 seconds to love your brand, or at least it should. That&#8217;s how long it takes for someone to form a first impression of your brand. And if you&#8217;re not making an emotional connection with your audience in that fraction of a second, you&#8217;re missing out on a huge opportunity to win their hearts and minds.</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the thing: visuals aren&#8217;t always the best way to make that emotional connection. In fact, when it comes to hitting emotions quickly, audio can often be more effective than visuals. That&#8217;s because sound has a direct line to our emotions, bypassing our logical brains and going straight to our hearts.</p>



<h2><strong>Music to Inspire</strong></h2>



<p>Music is a powerful tool for inspiring emotions. It has the ability to transport us to different places, evoke feelings of nostalgia, and ignite our imaginations. If you want to inspire your audience, consider using music to create a mood that encourages them to think bigger, dream larger, and reach higher.</p>



<p>Here are some ways to use music to inspire your audience:</p>



<h3>Use Uplifting Melodies &amp; Harmonies</h3>



<p>Uplifting melodies and harmonies can create a sense of optimism and positivity. They can make your audience feel like anything is possible, and encourage them to dream big. When choosing music to inspire your audience, look for melodies and harmonies that are bright, energetic, and upbeat.</p>



<h3>Incorporate Powerful Lyrics</h3>



<p>Lyrics are a powerful tool for inspiring emotions. They can tell stories, paint pictures, and convey messages that stick with your audience long after the music has stopped. When choosing music to inspire your audience, look for songs with lyrics that are positive, uplifting, and empowering.</p>



<h3>Use Music to Create a Sense of Unity</h3>



<p>Music has the power to bring people together. When you use music to create a sense of unity, you can inspire your audience to work together towards a common goal. Consider using songs that encourage teamwork, cooperation, and collaboration.</p>

<h2><strong>Music to Activate</strong></h2>



<p>If you want to get your audience moving, music can be a powerful tool. It has the ability to energize and motivate, getting people up and out of their seats. When used correctly, music can be a powerful motivator for physical activity, making it a great choice for workout classes, sports events, and other activities that require physical exertion.</p>



<p>Here are some ways to use music to activate your audience:</p>



<h3>Use High-Energy Tracks</h3>



<p>High-energy tracks are perfect for getting your audience moving. Look for songs with fast tempos, driving rhythms, and a strong beat. When you play high-energy tracks, you&#8217;ll find that your audience becomes more energized and motivated.</p>



<h3>Use Music to Create a Sense of Anticipation</h3>



<p>Music can be a powerful tool for creating a sense of anticipation. When you use music to build tension, you can get your audience excited about what&#8217;s coming next. Consider using music to create a countdown, signaling that something big is about to happen.</p>



<h3>Use Music to Set the Pace</h3>



<p>Music can be a great tool for setting the pace of physical activity. When you use music with a specific tempo, you can help your audience stay on beat and maintain a consistent pace. This can be especially useful in workout classes, where music can help participants stay motivated and engaged.</p>



<h2><strong>Music to Agitate</strong></h2>



<p>Sometimes, you need to use music to agitate your audience. This can be a powerful tool for getting people to take action, whether that action is making a purchase, signing a petition, or taking to the streets to protest. When used correctly, music can be a powerful motivator for change.</p>

<p>Here are some more ways to use music to agitate your audience:</p>



<h3>Use Dissonant or Unsettling Sounds</h3>



<p>Dissonant or unsettling sounds can be a powerful tool for creating a sense of unease or tension. These sounds can create a feeling of agitation or even anger, making them a great choice for political rallies, protests, or other events where you want to motivate your audience to take action.</p>



<h3>Incorporate Lyrics that Challenge the Status Quo</h3>

<h2>10 Powerful Social Media Ecommerce Strategies</h2>



<p>Here are ten powerful social media ecommerce strategies you can employ to drive sales for your brand:</p>



<h3>1. Set Clear Goals</h3>



<p>Setting clear and measurable goals should be the first step in your social media ecommerce strategy. Goals will provide you with direction, help measure success, and hold you accountable.</p>



<p>But what kind of goals should you set?</p>



<p>The most common ones can be:</p>



<ul>
<li>Drive Sales on Your Social Profile</li>



<li>Drive Traffic to Your Ecommerce Store</li>



<li>Get More Customer Queries/Leads</li>
</ul>



<p>Other than these, you might want people to subscribe to your newsletter or loyalty programs.</p>



<p>These and other similar targets could all be part of your e-commerce social media goals.</p>



<p>But the important thing here is to decide whether you want to do social selling, social commerce, or social media ecommerce marketing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165660" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-2.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Social Selling vs. Social Commerce vs. Social Media Ecommerce: What&#8217;s the Difference?</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Social selling</em></strong> is the practice of using social media to attract your target audience, engage with them, and nurture your relationship with them.</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t actually sell them anything but make them remember and trust your brand or business. So, when they&#8217;re in the buying mode, they know who they&#8217;d be calling &#8211; that&#8217;s social selling!</p>



<p><strong><em>Social commerce</em></strong> involves marketing and selling your product (or service) directly on social media platforms.</p>



<p>Social media users can stay on their social profiles, read about the product/service, and buy it &#8212; all of this without leaving the platform.</p>



<p>Facebook, TikTok, Instagram Shops and Pinterest Product Pins are typical examples of social commerce being executed.</p>



<p><strong><em>Social media ecommerce marketing</em></strong> is what we&#8217;re studying in the blog right now: marketing your product, generating leads, and helping future prospects on social media but then driving them to your online stores.</p>



<p>So, first, decide what it&#8217;s gonna be for you and then move forward.</p>



<h3>2. Build Your Social Media Strategy for Ecommerce </h3>



<p>After you&#8217;ve set your goals, build a comprehensive ecommerce social media marketing strategy that helps you achieve them.</p>



<p>Your strategy should include the following:</p>



<p><strong>Define Your Target Audiences</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Who are your potential customers?</li>



<li>Are they millennials or Gen Z?</li>



<li>What do they like and dislike?</li>



<li>What interests them?</li>
</ul>



<p>These insights will help you create relevant content, campaigns, and offers.</p>

</div></div>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Create Relevant Content</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Research the type of content that resonates best with your target audiences &#8212; blogs, videos, images?</li>



<li>Study your target market and see what kind of content attracts them.</li>



<li>Use this knowledge to create content that will help you engage with them.</li>
</ul>



<p>But before you can do any of this, there&#8217;s an even more important decision to make: &#8220;What platforms should you choose?&#8221;</p>



<h3>3. Choose Your Preferred Social Media Channels</h3>



<p>Which social media platforms should your business have an active presence on?</p>



<p>This largely depends on who you&#8217;re targeting. For example, Gen Zee tends to be more active on TikTok and Instagram, while millennials prefer Facebook and Twitter.</p>



<p>But don&#8217;t depend on our or somebody else&#8217;s opinion. Study your target audience and see what the data suggests.</p>



<p>For instance, if your target audience primarily comprises women, it might be a good idea to have a Pinterest profile. Why? Because women make up 60% of all Pinterest users!</p>



<p>Similarly, you can study age demographic stats and see where your audience spends the most time and choose a platform accordingly.</p>



<p>Besides your target audience, also consider each platform&#8217;s features and ROI. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to invest heavily in a channel that won&#8217;t give you the desired results.</p>



<p>So, think carefully and choose wisely!</p>



<h3>4. Optimize Your Profiles</h3>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve chosen the platform(s), it&#8217;s time to optimize your profile.</p>



<p>Make sure that all your social media profiles have the necessary information about your brand and products, such as its logo, contact details, website URL, etc.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-3-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165661" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-3.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This will help customers get to know your business better and trust you more.</p>



<p>Also, don&#8217;t forget to do proper keyword research. It will help you figure out the best words to use in your descriptions and hashtags to use in your posts to get more people interested.</p>



<h3>5. Have a &#8220;Mobile-First&#8221; Approach</h3>



<p>Out of <strong>4.48</strong> billion social media users, <strong>99%</strong> access the websites or apps through a mobile device &#8211;<a href="https://backlinko.com/social-media-users" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> backlinko</a>.</p>



<p>What does it tell you?</p>



<p>You must adapt your ecommerce strategy accordingly and make sure that all content looks great on small screens too.</p>



<p>Here are some tips to optimize your social media accounts:</p>



<ul>
<li>Invest in creating high-quality visuals that look great on small screens.</li>



<li>Make sure your website is mobile responsive, and the checkout process is easy to complete.</li>



<li>Utilize mobile advertising tools like Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, etc.</li>



<li>Use shorter hashtags and URLs to make them easier to tap or type on mobile keyboards.</li>



<li>Use a clear call-to-action in your posts so that users can take action right away.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Important:</strong> Having a responsive and easy-to-navigate ecommerce website is super important &#8211; don&#8217;t sleep on it!</p>



<h3>6. Employ Chatbots</h3>



<p>Chatbots are like your brand&#8217;s trusty sidekick in the world of social media ecommerce!</p>



<p>Did you know that around 50% of people are totally on board with making a purchase through a website&#8217;s chatbot using conversational marketing? That&#8217;s right! These friendly virtual assistants can offer personalized and real-time assistance to your customers, making their shopping experience a breeze.</p>



<p>Need product recommendations? Chatbot&#8217;s got you covered!</p>



<p>Have a question about shipping? Chatbot&#8217;s got the answer!</p>



<p>By having chatbots as part of your social media ecommerce strategy, you can provide instant support, boost engagement, and, most importantly, drive those all-important sales.</p>



<p>So, why not harness the power of chatbots and make your customers&#8217; journey even more enjoyable?</p>



<h3>7. Leverage UGC (User-Generated Content) </h3>



<p>UGC refers to content created by your customers, such as reviews, testimonials, photos, and videos featuring your products.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s one of the most powerful tools for driving engagement and boosting sales.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s like having an army of brand advocates who are eager to spread the word about your offerings.</li>



<li>UGC showcases real-life experiences and authentic customer interactions with your brand.</li>



<li>It builds trust and credibility among your target audience as it comes from real customers.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-4-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165662" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-4-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-4-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-4-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10-Strategies-to-Mastering-Social-Media-for-Ecommerce-4.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Plus, it&#8217;s not just about showing off your products &#8211; it&#8217;s about making customers feel part of a community. It shows that you value their input and recognize their contribution to the brand.</p>



<p>So, why not include UGC in your social media ecommerce strategy?</p>



<p>Encourage your followers to post pictures with their purchases, use relevant hashtags, and provide incentives for doing so.</p>



<h3>8. Publish Short-Form Content </h3>



<p>Today, short-form content reigns supreme! With dwindling attention spans, social media users prefer watching short, 30sec-1min videos instead of reading text.</p>



<p>This is exactly what brands need to capitalize on and capture their audience&#8217;s interest quickly and effectively.</p>



<p>But what kind of short-form content can you create to engage your social media followers? Here are some ideas for short-form content:</p>



<ol>

<li>How-Tos: Break down complex processes into step-by-step guides.</li>



<li>Behind the Scenes: Offer glimpses into your brand&#8217;s inner workings.</li>



<li>Quick Product Demos: Showcase your products&#8217; features and benefits in short videos.</li>



<li>Inspiring Stories: Share stories that evoke emotions and inspire action.</li>
</ol>



<p>Remember to keep your content visually appealing, concise, and shareable.</p>



<p>Try different formats like Reels, Stories, or TikTok-style videos to maximize engagement and captivate your audience instantly!</p>



<h3>9. Collaborate with Influencers</h3>



<p>Did you know that a whopping 72% of Gen Z and Millennials are avid followers of influencers on social media? That&#8217;s right!</p>



<p>Influencer marketing has taken the digital world by storm, and it&#8217;s an incredible opportunity for ecommerce brands like yours to connect with your target audience in a meaningful way.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s how you can incorporate influencer marketing into your ecommerce marketing plan:</p>



<ul>

<p>By collaborating with influencers, you can amplify your brand&#8217;s reach, enhance credibility, and drive meaningful results in the competitive ecommerce landscape.</p>



<h3>10 . Track Progress &amp; Evolve</h3>



<p>Tracking and analyzing the results of your social media ecommerce strategies is vital for ongoing success.</p>



<p>Analytics tools can give you valuable insights into audience demographics, reach, and engagement.</p>



<p>Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter provide built-in analytics dashboards to assess post performance. Use them to understand audience behavior and analyze what&#8217;s working for you.</p>



<p>Similarly, monitoring ad performance is especially important if you&#8217;re selling directly on social media. Tracking metrics such as click-through rates, conversion rates, and sales will help you assess the effectiveness of your ads and make data-driven decisions.</p>



<p>Besides analyzing your social media posts, keep a close on your website analytics (Google Analytics) to measure the impact of your social media campaigns. See which platform gets you the most traffic and which one&#8217;s not doing the job.</p>

<p></p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t think it was a big deal. We assumed these were typical results for those who focused and did the work.</p>



<p>The gaping mouths and the bulging eyes were our first clues. My next clue should have been when one podcaster told me he gets 50 to 100 pitches a week and he chose ours. Finally, reality set in like a bolt of lightning striking fifty feet in front of me. The words still rumble in my head like fading thunder echoing through the sky:</p>



<p><em>“I&#8217;ve never known anyone who booked 53 podcasts in two months.&#8221;</em> &#8211; <a href="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/faculty/ryan-deiss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Deiss</a></p>



<p>When Ryan said that from the stage at the M3 Mastermind, I finally realized my wife had done something extraordinary. This was no surprise.</p>



<p>She is an amazing woman. Anyone who read her CaringBridge journal in 2021 already knows that. TLDR: The doctors gave up on me and told her to &#8220;pull the plug.&#8221; She didn&#8217;t. She prevailed. I&#8217;m alive.</p>

<p>So, in March of 2023 I asked her to come to my rescue again. This time it was much lower stakes. I asked her to get me booked on podcasts.</p>



<h2><strong>Why Pursue Being a Podcast Guest?</strong></h2>



<p>Guesting on podcasts is a way to expand your own audience. According to ListenNotes, there are more than three million podcasts. The podcast hosts did the time consuming work of building their audience. And as a podcast guest, you get nearly effortless access to that audience.</p>



<p>Guest interviews are a great way to build your authority. Almost every host launches the podcast episode talking about how awesome you are. Their audience trusts them&#8230; and now their audience &#8211; the podcast listeners &#8211; trust you.</p>



<p>Your guest podcast interview will drive business and opportunities. Our 90-day rolling pipeline report tells that story best. &#8220;FTO Deals&#8221;, our discovery call metric, is up 700% compared to the prior 90-days when we weren&#8217;t guesting on podcasts. </p>



<p>&#8220;FTOs Sold&#8221; means we closed a new client. That&#8217;s up 400% compared to the prior 90-days. And we expect that to rise further because most of the discovery calls haven&#8217;t happened yet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165613" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results2.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fill your pipeline by being a podcast guest</figcaption></figure>



<p>Our podcast focus started within this 90-day view. Most of the podcast episodes are scheduled to go live in the next couple of months. And yet we&#8217;re seeing triple-digit 90-on-90 growth on our most important metrics.</p>



<p>Look closer and you&#8217;ll see another hidden nugget. Double-digit lead growth drove triple-digit opportunity and sales growth. That&#8217;s what authority does for you.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re running out of ways to unleash an instant triple-digit firehose on your business, then read on. I&#8217;ll show you how we did it.</p>



<h2><strong>How to Get on a Podcast: How it Started</strong></h2>



<p>Be careful when you curse adversity in your life. If you let adversity be your mentor, it will rip the scales off your eyes and a world of new opportunities becomes crystal clear. And that&#8217;s what happened here.</p>



<p>It began in November 2022 when NCR laid off my wife, Karen. We&#8217;re not upset with NCR. They&#8217;ve been wonderful to Karen. For the three months I was in the hospital, they let her work half-time while paying her full-time. But the layoff was a shock.</p>



<p>While Karen was trying to figure out her &#8220;next thing,&#8221; I asked her if she could get me booked on podcasts. She clearly knocked the cover off the ball and accidentally found her &#8220;next thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her first step was research. Why would a podcast host want me on their podcast? Podcast hosts receive tens or hundreds of pitches each week. They&#8217;re looking for their ideal podcast guests. So, the outreach email is key.</p>



<h2><strong>Create a Personalized Outreach Email for Each of the Podcast Hosts</strong></h2>



<p>Sorry, there are no shortcuts here. Automated mass outreach won&#8217;t get you guest appearances on any of the relevant podcasts.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll break down one of Karen&#8217;s emails step-by-step so you can see the key elements.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-Email-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165631" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-Email-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-Email-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-Email-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-Email-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-Email.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2><strong>The Intro: Praise the Podcast Host for Their Mission</strong></h2>



<p>Praise the host for their mission. Connect with their &#8220;Why.&#8221; Go to their podcast page. They&#8217;ll almost certainly make their mission clear there. They&#8217;ll also help you identify their target audience. Make sure their target audience aligns with your target audience. Otherwise, you&#8217;re just wasting their time.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an example of Karen&#8217;s intro:</p>



<p><em>Hi Roy,<br><br> My name is Karen and I work on behalf of Craig Andrews.&nbsp; We have been listening to your podcast and love what you are doing!&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165677" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Recognize and applaud the podcast host’s superpower</figcaption></figure>



<p>Make sure you get their name right!! Ryan Deiss said he gets outreach emails every week praising <strong>him </strong>for <strong>his </strong>interviews on the <a href="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DigitalMarketer podcast</a>. The problem is Ryan doesn&#8217;t do the podcast. Getting the host&#8217;s name wrong is the first clue that you&#8217;re doing spammy outreach.</p>



<p>Next, praise their mission. We could improve this outreach by being specific in praising the mission we see them fulfilling. That would probably boost our results further. But even this generic simplicity has been working. But that&#8217;s because of the next paragraph.</p>



<h2><strong>The Intro: Reference a Specific Podcast Episode &amp; What You Learned</strong></h2>



<p>This is the most time-consuming part of the process. And no, you can&#8217;t automate this.</p>



<p>A leading podcast host achieved their vaulted position by being selective in their podcast guests. So, your window of opportunity is through a few scarce words that communicate you&#8217;ll be a great podcast guest. And great podcast guests speak to their audience by knowing their audience.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165678" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-2.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Reference a specific episode in your podcast outreach email</figcaption></figure>



<p>So, you need to listen to an episode. Make your outreach email reference:</p>



<ul>
<li>A specific episode.</li>



<li>A specific guest.</li>



<li>A specific insight you got from that episode.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here&#8217;s what that looks like in Karen&#8217;s outreach:</p>



<p><em>We recently listened to your podcast with Tom Sharp about Strategy Patterns for Business Growth.&nbsp; We really appreciated his idea that you need to know yourself, your boundaries and your goals and doing the work to understand those goals.</em></p>



<p><strong>BOOM!</strong> Do that and you just distinguished yourself as a podcast guest that cared enough to actually listen to their podcast. You don&#8217;t have to listen to all the podcast interviews. One is enough.</p>



<p>Now you have their attention. Next you must prove you&#8217;ll bring the goods to serve their audience.</p>



<h2><strong>The Meat: Bring the Heat &amp; Add Value to the Podcast Listeners</strong></h2>



<p>Bring something new to the table. You&#8217;re not going to get booked by pitching &#8220;How to Grow Your Business Using Facebook Ads.&#8221; That was fresh and relevant about a decade ago. But you may get booked with something more current like:</p>



<p><em>How you can overcome Facebook&#8217;s recent trend of reduced targeting with four carefully selected headline elements.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-3-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165679" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-3.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bring something that’s both unknown and valuable</figcaption></figure>



<p>In our case, we specialize in accelerating high-ticket sales. So, we wanted to find podcasts that had a podcast audience with people that fit that description.</p>



<p>In 2023, high-ticket businesses are struggling closing deals. So, our guest podcasting is focused on building irresistible First-Time Offers to overcome the tough economic conditions. This is a great message for podcast audiences that are struggling with sales. Here&#8217;s what that looks like in Karen&#8217;s email:</p>



<p><em>Craig has some fresh thoughts for our currently tough economy that he thought would benefit your audience.</em><em><br></em><em><br></em><em> He specializes in First-Time Offers that serve as a “coffee date” to begin an engagement with a potential customer.&nbsp; Help before you sell!</em></p>



<p>Again, our goal isn&#8217;t to be on all the podcasts &#8211; just the ones with our ideal customers. So, we want the message to enchant our perfect podcast hosts while repelling other podcasts that aren&#8217;t ideal.</p>



<p>Once you have them enchanted, next deal with their fear.</p>



<h2><strong>The Promise: Convince the Podcast Hosts You&#8217;re Not a Greedy Bastard</strong></h2>



<p>The podcast world is about giving &#8211; not taking. So, don&#8217;t be a greedy bastard.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the world is oversupplied with shysters and takers. Your outreach email needs to quickly communicate that your guest appearance will focus on giving. Promise a free gift for the podcast host&#8217;s audience.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-4-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165680" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-4-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-4-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-4-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-4.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Focus on serving and giving</figcaption></figure>



<p>Here&#8217;s what that looks like in Karen&#8217;s outreach:</p>



<p><em>He would love to offer a free gift to your audience as an additional way of adding value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>When you do that, you quickly communicate that you understand the unwritten agreement. It demonstrates your giving nature in action. It also communicates you&#8217;ve done this for other podcasts &#8211; so you&#8217;re an expert guest and a giver. Win-win-win&#8230;</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not enough. You&#8217;ve got to bring more to the table.</p>



<h2><strong>The Sizzle: Promise to be an Interesting Podcast Guest</strong></h2>

<p>Ben Stein brought humor to Ferris Bueller&#8217;s Day Off by being the most boring economics teacher on the planet. But let&#8217;s be honest&#8230; you&#8217;re no Ben Stein.</p>



<p>Unlike Ben Stein, you have not mastered the craft of being entertaining by being boring. The only way you&#8217;ll land on someone else&#8217;s podcast is by being interesting. Promise to tell a story. Look through your life and find interesting stories that tie into your core message.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what that looks like in Karen&#8217;s outreach:</p>



<p><em>A few interesting things about Craig:</em><em><br></em><em>He spent 6 years in the Marines.</em><em><br></em><em>He lived and studied in Japan.</em><em><br></em><em>He received a graduate degree in Electrical Engineering and later figured out he loved marketing.</em><em><br></em><em>In 2021, he spent 3 months in the hospital and woke up from a coma only able to wiggle a finger and a toe.&nbsp; His recovery has been a miracle.</em></p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-vertically-aligned-center has-pale-ocean-gradient-background has-background" style="grid-template-columns:25% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="246" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ContentCertification_Header1-300x246.png" alt="Content Marketing Certification" class="wp-image-156628 size-thumbnail"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">

<p>Life gifted me with a white-knuckled story of narrowly escaping death. So, yes, I pimp the heck out of that story. But I&#8217;ve discovered that some podcast hosts really don&#8217;t care about my near early departure from this world.</p>



<p>Karen offers a variety of interesting life events so the podcast host can pick one that interests them most. Look through your life and find interesting stories that you can use to illustrate core elements of your message.</p>



<h2><strong>The Close: Bring the Social Proof</strong></h2>



<p>Top hosts want to know that you&#8217;ve been on other podcasts. Nobody wants to train you on being a great podcast guest. It may feel like podcast access is limited to those who&#8217;ve already been on a bunch of podcasts.</p>



<p>But every podcast guest started with their first podcast. Then they went on more podcasts and built social proof. That&#8217;s been the case with me. Here&#8217;s how Karen handles that:</p>



<p><em>Craig has presented at Conversion Conference, various Vistage groups and other podcasts.</em></p>



<p>Karen used what we had in our arsenal. Yes, I have been on two or three podcasts. In one case I was episode #3 on a podcast that shut down after the 4th episode. But that&#8217;s still social proof.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-6-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-165682" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-6-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-6-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-6-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-6-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-to-Get-Booked-as-a-Guest-on-Podcasts-and-Get-Staggering-Results-6.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Find someone who thinks you’re awesome and quote them</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you&#8217;re just starting out, get a testimonial from your mom. Hopefully she thinks you&#8217;re awesome. Figure out what group she&#8217;s involved in&#8230; like her neighborhood gardening group. Speak to them about something that interests them. Here&#8217;s what that review looks like:</p>



<p><em>Craig brought an amazing message to the East Peoria Gardening Club. Everyone was captivated by his stories of how rosemary represents the essential spice that should be a part of everyone&#8217;s garden of life.&#8221; &#8211; Mary Andrews, President of the East Peoria Gardening Club.</em></p>



<p>Get on one podcast and use that as social proof to get on bigger podcasts. Remember, you&#8217;re not alone. If you&#8217;re trying to break into the guest podcasting space, there are also many new podcast hosts trying to break into the space as well. You&#8217;re perfect for each other.</p>



<h2><strong>The Close: Give a Call-to-Action to be Their Next Podcast Guest</strong></h2>



<p>It&#8217;s easy to forget the Call-to-Action (CTA). Don&#8217;t let it be implicit. Actively call the host to action. We steal some wisdom from Chris Voss and structure our CTA to be a natural &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Would it be a ridiculous idea to set up a call to see how he can meet the unique needs of your listeners?</em></p>



<p>Notice how the CTA brings the focus back on their audience instead of you. That reinforces the idea that you&#8217;ll bring value to their audience.</p>



<h2><strong>Other Things Podcast Guests Need to Consider</strong></h2>



<p>Of course there are other things you need to consider in addition to the outreach email. Maximize use of the podcast directories. I recommend you create a speaker page that includes speaking examples, your bio, head shots and other assets.</p>



<p>Those are each a subject of their own. So, we&#8217;ll talk about those in other articles. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you should wait. Today is the time to begin your journey as a podcast guest.</p>



<p>Stop reading. Set your timer. Use the next 15-minutes to write your first draft of your podcast outreach email. You can perfect it later.</p>



<h2><strong>Put it to Work &#8211; Get Booked as a Guest</strong></h2>



<p>This journey began because I heard <a href="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/faculty/lauren-petrullo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lauren Petrullo</a> proclaim her goal. She set out to get on 100 podcasts before the end of the year. I didn&#8217;t know what I didn&#8217;t know. Neither did Karen. So, we set the same goal.</p>



<p>One of my favorite quotes is by General George S. Patton:</p>



<p><em>“A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>General Patton was the only allied commander that Field Marshal Rommel feared. Patton&#8217;s philosophy allowed him to make the impossible possible.</p>



<p>If there&#8217;s any genius in what we&#8217;ve done it&#8217;s that we set a crazy goal and aggressively pursued it. We were so ignorant of podcasting that we didn&#8217;t realize how exceptional our results were until several folks told us. Now it&#8217;s your turn. Go and do the same.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence is a game changer for marketing. While AI will be useful in many industries, the nature of the marketing profession makes it even more powerful, from the need for constant content generation, to ideation for advertising concepts, to automation for day-to-day operations, AI is the biggest innovation in marketing since the internet.</p>



<p>Since the beginning of 2023, the amount of AI tools for marketing has <strong>exploded</strong>. </p>



<p>While there&#8217;s no official count of new AI applications since the beginning of the year, if you monitor websites like <a href="https://theresanaiforthat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TheresanAIforThat.com</a>, you&#8217;ll find dozens to hundreds of new applications being added every day, with the current list including 4,600+ apps covering over 1,300 tasks. </p>



<p>Further, the investment in new AI companies has rapidly expanded. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), investments in AI software, hardware, and software for AI-centric systems will increase 26.9% to $154 billion in 2023 over 2022, with $300 billion expected by 2026 (<a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS50454123#:~:text=NEEDHAM%2C%20Mass.%2C%20March%207,in%202023%2C%20an%20increase%20of" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SOURCE</a>). </p>



<p>In 2021, the investment in AI doubled globally from less than $40 billion to almost $80 billion (<a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/report-ai-investments-see-largest-year-over-year-growth-in-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SOURCE</a>), and look what has come from that!</p>



<p>Needless to say, there are many, many choices when it comes to AI applications, and it can be difficult to nail down which ones to use, much less which ones you should focus on.</p>



<p><strong>After discussing the topic for dozens of marketing professionals and AI experts, I&#8217;ve come to a simple conclusion: marketers should master ChatGPT BEFORE anything else. </strong></p>



<p>Here I&#8217;ll explain why.</p>



<h2>Why Marketers Need to Focus on AI Skill Development</h2>



<p>Marketers are notorious for falling prey to &#8220;shiny object syndrome.&#8221; It&#8217;s no surprise why&#8230; the easiest person to get sold is a salesman after all!</p>



<p>There are always new methods, platforms, techniques, tricks, tips, and tools to make your marketing faster, better, and more effective. Every company needs marketing to succeed, and the impact of good marketing can make or break your organization.</p>



<p><strong>AI is the shiniest object of all for marketers&#8230;</strong></p>



<p>Here&#8217;s why AI is such a vital development in the marketing industry:</p>



<p><strong>Ideation</strong>: Marketers and marketing agencies may have to create multiple concepts for content and advertising for each client every day. This need for volumes of creativity was time consuming and tiring, but with AI the process has become 10 times easier. No more lag time between needing to brainstorm and creating new concepts&#8230; AI makes it almost instant.</p>



<p><strong>Volume Creation</strong>: In addition to massive amounts of new concepts and ideas, AI also provides the ability to create brand-specific content whenever necessary. By &#8220;training your AI&#8221; to create content based on a particular style, marketers can create new advertising copy, landing page headlines and text, email drip campaigns, social media descriptions, lead magnet materials, and much more 10 times faster than before.</p>



<p><strong>Personalization</strong>: With AI, marketers unlock the power of personalized experiences on a large scale. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning, AI comprehends individual preferences, behaviors, and purchase patterns. Marketers can then tailor their messaging, recommendations, and offers to each customer, creating engaging interactions that drive conversions.</p>



<p><strong>Data-driven Insights</strong>: AI&#8217;s ability to swiftly and accurately process vast amounts of data empowers marketers with valuable insights. They can delve into customer behavior, market trends, and campaign performance. AI-driven analytics tools offer actionable recommendations based on data, enabling marketers to make informed decisions and optimize strategies for superior outcomes.</p>



<p><strong>Customer Support &amp; Chatbots</strong>: AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants provide instant and personalized customer support. They excel at handling customer inquiries, offering product recommendations, and facilitating purchase decisions. Available 24/7, AI chatbots enhance response times and boost customer satisfaction by delivering prompt and relevant assistance.</p>



<p><strong>Predictive Analytics</strong>: AI algorithms leverage historical data to predict future outcomes, empowering marketers to anticipate customer needs and behavior. Predictive analytics aids in optimizing marketing campaigns, identifying high-value customers, and forecasting sales trends. With these insights, marketers can allocate resources effectively and enhance overall campaign performance.</p>



<p><strong>Automation &amp; Efficiency</strong>: By automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks, AI liberates marketers to focus on strategic endeavors. AI-powered tools automate email marketing, social media scheduling, content generation, and data analysis. This streamlined automation boosts efficiency, productivity, and eliminates manual effort.</p>



<p><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong>: Marketers gain a competitive edge by harnessing the potential of AI. AI-powered tools enable advanced market research, competitor analysis, and trend forecasting. By staying ahead of industry developments, marketers can make proactive decisions that differentiate their brand and seize opportunities for success.</p>



<p>With all that said, you will severely limit your ability to use AI if you bounce around from application to application. That&#8217;s why you need to get focused.</p>



<h2>Why You Need to Limit the Amount of AI Applications You Use</h2>



<p>While AI may be new to the marketing profession, the need to focus on a particular set of skills has been around since the dawn of the position.</p>



<p>Skills like copywriting, product positioning, data analysis, customer service, communication, networking, adaptability, and innovation are keystones to the professional marketer.</p>



<p><strong>The ability to utilize AI is just the latest one.</strong></p>



<p>I&#8217;ve found that the principle of minimalism allows for the quickest development of new skills. Unfortunately, trying to learn how to use a dozen new tools goes against this philosophy&#8230; you need to limit the number of new applications if you really want to master one.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s why the principle of minimalism applies to AI skill development:</p>



<p><strong>Intentionality</strong>: In the world of minimalism, intentionality reigns supreme. It urges individuals to deliberate and question whether they truly require an array of specialized tools or if a single tool can serve their needs just as well. By consciously evaluating the functionality and purpose of each tool, you can make mindful decisions that align with their specific requirements.</p>



<p><strong>Simplification</strong>: Minimalism champions the art of simplification, both in life and possessions. By minimizing the number of tools and opting for multi-functional alternatives, you can declutter your tool collection, streamline their workflow, and eliminate unnecessary complexities. Embracing simplicity allows for a more efficient and unencumbered approach.</p>



<a href="https://img1.niftyimages.com/click/6y5/d3xh/0a7h">
  <img decoding="async" src="https://img1.niftyimages.com/6y5/d3xh/0a7h">
</a>



<p><strong>Functionality over Excess</strong>: Minimalism urges us to prioritize functionality above all else. Instead of amassing an abundance of tools for each specific task, the focus shifts towards identifying a versatile tool that can effectively serve multiple purposes. By valuing functionality over excessive accumulation, minimalism fosters efficiency and resourcefulness in our endeavors.</p>



<p><strong>Mindful Consumption</strong>: At the heart of minimalism lies the principle of mindful consumption. Rather than succumbing to impulsive or societal pressures, minimalism encourages you to consciously evaluate your needs. By carefully considering the necessity of each tool and making choices aligned with those needs, we reduce excessive consumption and wastefulness. Mindful consumption promotes a more intentional and sustainable way of living.</p>



<p>With all that said, there&#8217;s many reasons why ChatGPT is the marketers-choice for AI skill development.</p>



<h2>Why Marketers Should Focus on ChatGPT</h2>



<p>Yes, there are newer and more specific AI tools out there, but ChatGPT is still the standard when it comes to marketing, and for good reason.</p>



<p>The following is just a few of the reasons why the use of ChatGPT should be a primary focus of marketers.</p>



<h3>Conversational Superpower</h3>



<p>ChatGPT possesses unparalleled conversational superpowers that elevate customer engagement to new heights. With its natural language processing capabilities, ChatGPT can simulate human-like interactions, leading to more personalized and meaningful conversations with customers. </p>



<p>Marketers can harness this power to provide tailored recommendations, answer queries promptly, and build strong connections that foster brand loyalty.</p>



<p>Further, marketing is one of the few areas of business where a conversational style is more effective than technical communication styles, making ChatGPT ideal for this type of content generation.</p>



<h3>Versatile Marketing Applications</h3>



<p>ChatGPT&#8217;s versatility empowers marketers to excel across multiple marketing applications. Whether it&#8217;s content creation, customer support, lead generation, or even social media management, ChatGPT delivers exceptional performance. </p>



<p>Marketers can leverage ChatGPT to generate engaging blog posts, automate personalized email campaigns, and handle customer inquiries efficiently—all from a single AI tool.</p>



<p>Better yet, as marketers utilize ChatGPT they&#8217;ll start to define their prompting style, creating more and more content from less prompts.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-vertically-aligned-center has-pale-ocean-gradient-background has-background" style="grid-template-columns:25% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SocialMedia-300x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-155571 size-thumbnail" srcset="https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SocialMedia-300x300.png 300w, https://dmwsprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SocialMedia-300x300-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">

</div></div>



<h3>Standardized Brand Voice for Unlimited Companies</h3>



<p>With ChatGPT as their exclusive AI tool, marketers gain a profound advantage in crafting hyper-targeted campaigns that utilize a consistent brand voice. </p>



<p>ChatGPT&#8217;s ability to understand individual preferences, behaviors, and purchase patterns allows for laser-focused messaging. Marketers can tailor their content and offers to resonate with each customer on a deeper level, resulting in improved engagement, higher conversions, and increased ROI.</p>



<p>Since marketers often focus on more than one company or client at a time, ChatGPT allows for continuous content development through individual chats that maintain the organization&#8217;s brand voice without the need for a technical account set up each time. It doesn&#8217;t care how many clients you take care of, meaning both cost and time savings.</p>



<h3>Continuous Learning &amp; Improvement</h3>



<p>ChatGPT&#8217;s continuous learning capabilities enable marketers to stay ahead of the curve. Through ongoing training and exposure to real-world data, ChatGPT adapts and evolves to meet changing customer needs and industry dynamics. </p>



<p>Marketers can capitalize on this adaptive learning to refine their strategies, optimize campaign performance, and drive continuous improvement.</p>



<h3>Dependable Development &amp; Longevity</h3>



<p>Few, if any, companies have spent more money or received more investment than OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT. Microsoft has invested over $13 billion in the company to date (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/microsofts-complex-bet-on-openai-brings-potential-and-uncertainty.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SOURCE</a>), and with a valuation of $29 billion, OpenAI won&#8217;t be disappearing any time soon.</p>



<p>Further, with over 100 million users and an expected revenue of $1 billion by 2024, the company is strong and growing (<a href="https://www.demandsage.com/chatgpt-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SOURCE</a>). If any company will lead the way in consolidating smaller companies with similar solutions, it&#8217;s this one.</p>



<h2>How to Develop Your ChatGPT Marketing Skills</h2>
